"JacquesLouis David French ʒaklwi david 30 August 1748  29 December 1825 was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s, his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity, severity, and heightened feeling, which harmonized with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime. David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre 17581794, and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierres fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release that of Napoleon, the First Consul of France. At this time he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleons fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had many pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.    Early life   JacquesLouis David was born into a prosperous French family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his welloff architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the Collège des QuatreNations, University of Paris, but he was never a good studenthe had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, I was always hiding behind the instructors chair, drawing for the duration of the class. Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from François Boucher 17031770, the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a Rococo painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over Davids tutelage, he would send David to his friend, JosephMarie Vien 17161809, a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There, David attended the Royal Academy, based in what is now the Louvre.  Each year the academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious Prix de Rome, which funded a 3 to 5year stay in Rome. Since artists were now revisiting classical styles, the trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Called pensionnaire they were housed in the French Academys Rome outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David made three consecutive attempts to win the annual prize, with Minerva Fighting Mars, Diana and Apollo Killing Niobes Children and The Death of Seneca with each failure allegedly contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution. After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zealonly to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus Disease, a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, JosephMarie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the French Academy at Rome. While in Italy, David mostly studied the works of 17thcentury masters such as Poussin, Caravaggio, and the Carracci. Although he declared, the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move, David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter Raphael Mengs 17281779, who opposed the Rococo tendency to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced Davids prerevolutionary painting, such as The Vestal Virgin, probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by Johann Joachim Winckelmann 17171768, the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history. As part of the Prix de Rome, David toured the newly excavated ruins of Pompeii in 1779, which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power. During the trip David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, Raphael making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist.    Early work   Although Davids fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, they recognized his genius. Davids stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year. In July 1780, he returned to Paris. There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made an official member of the Royal Academy. He sent the academy two paintings, and both were included in the Salon of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the Kings buildings, M. Pécoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, Marguerite Charlotte. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had about 50 of his own pupils and was commissioned by the government to paint Horace defended by his Father, but he soon decided, Only in Rome can I paint Romans. His fatherinlaw provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife, Charlotte, and three of his students, one of whom, JeanGermain Drouais 17631788, was the Prix de Rome winner of that year.  In Rome, David painted his famous Oath of the Horatii, 1784. In this piece, the artist references Enlightenment values while alluding to Rousseaus social contract. The republican ideal of the general became the central focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father. The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state. The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers. David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath. They also appear to be smaller in scale and physically isolated from the male figures. The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the mens rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition. Here we see the clear division of malefemale attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseaus popularized doctrine of separate spheres. These revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the Distribution of Eagles. While Oath of the Horatii and The Tennis Court Oath stress the importance of masculine selfsacrifice for ones country and patriotism, the Distribution of Eagles would ask for selfsacrifice for ones Emperor Napoleon and the importance of battlefield glory.  In 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly. The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the academy in years to come. For the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous Death of Socrates. Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the hemlock brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed. Critics compared the Socrates with Michelangelos Sistine Ceiling and Raphaels Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as in every sense perfect. Denis Diderot said it looked as if he copied it from some ancient basrelief. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal works of encouragement.  For his next painting, David created The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the French Revolution had begun. The National Assembly had been established, and the Bastille had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. Davids portrait of Lavoisier, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons. When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutuss sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, sacrificing his own family for the good of the republic. On the right, the mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France. It exemplified civic virtue, a value highly regarded during the Revolution.    The French Revolution  In the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of Maximilien Robespierre, and a member of the Jacobin Club. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed behind to help destroy the old order he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the execution of Louis XVI. It is uncertain why he did this, as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order some people suggest Davids love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government. Others believed that they found the key to the artists revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, Davids artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his powerful ambition...and unusual energy of will actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that generous ardor, highminded idealism and wellmeaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period. Soon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition to his work, as seen in previous episodes in Davids life. The Royal Academy was controlled by royalists, who opposed Davids attempts at reform so the National Assembly finally ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution. David then began work on something that would later hound him propaganda for the new republic. Davids painting of Brutus was shown during the play Brutus by Voltaire. In 1789, David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of The Oath of the Tennis Court. He undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The Kings acquiescence in the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the National Assembly on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by JeanSylvain Bailly, they made a solemn oath never to separate until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the ancien regime. Rejecting the current conditions, the oath signified a new transition in human history and ideology. David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event. This instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale the figures in the foreground were to be lifesized portraits of the counterparts, including JeanSylvain Bailly, the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project. David set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large penandink drawing. As in the Oath of the Horatii, David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray Davids deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be blowing through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution. Symbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time. The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations. The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowds arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape. Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the Tennis Court Oath.  In his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in real time, David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world. However, Thomas Crow argues that this path proved to be less a way forward than a culdesac for history painting. Essentially, the history of the demise of Davids The Tennis Court Oath illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences. Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in The Tennis Court Oath no longer existed in radicalized 1792. The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power. By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were heroes. A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate Davids work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned The Oath of the Tennis Court. To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message. When Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaires old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the Panthéon, as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791, David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthéon. Despite rain and opposition from conservatives due to the amount of money spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the Father of the Revolution being carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.  David incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals, in effect radicalizing the applied arts themselves. The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images, changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, Davids Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the Goddess of Liberty Marianne. Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism. In his speech during the procession, David explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident. The ideals that David linked to his Hercules singlehandedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite. Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around. In June 1791, the King made an illfated attempt to flee the country, but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Netherlands border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, MarieAntoinettes brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and MarieAntoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends JeanPaul Marat and Robespierre. In the convention, David soon earned the nickname ferocious terrorist. Robespierres agents discovered a secret vault containing the Kings correspondence which proved he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, Marguerite Charlotte, a royalist, to divorce him. When Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as wellLouis Michel le Peletier de SaintFargeau. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted Le Peletier Assassinated. In it, the assassins sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletiers body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written I vote the death of the tyrant, and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription David to Le Peletier. 20 January 1793. The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletiers royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts. Nevertheless, this work was important in Davids career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with The Death of Marat, Davids masterpiece.  On 13 July 1793, Davids friend Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday with a knife she had hidden in her clothing. She gained entrance to Marats house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France. Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him. She was guillotined shortly thereafter. Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in Davids subsequent painting, The Death of Marat. Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counterrevolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthéon. Marats body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marats body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July. The Death of Marat, perhaps Davids most famous painting, has been called the Pietà of the revolution. Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend their desolate voice was heard David, take up your brushes..., avenge Marat... I heard the voice of the people. I obeyed. The Death of Marat, 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution. This piece stands today as a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artists political convictions are directly manifested in his work. A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples. The subject although realistically depicted remains lifeless in a rather supernatural composition. With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene alluding to an out of this world existence. Atheists though they were, David and Marat, like so many other fervent social reformers of the modern world, seem to have created a new kind of religion. At the very center of these beliefs, there stood the republic.  After the Kings execution, war broke out between the new Republic and virtually every major power in Europe. David, as a member of the Committee of General Security, contributed directly to the Reign of Terror. David organized his last festival the festival of the Supreme Being. Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic and based on the ideas of Rousseau. This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state. The festivals, called fêtes, would be the method of indoctrination. On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the revolutionary calendar, Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath. Soon, the war began to go well French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands which would later become Belgium, and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more. Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror. As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you. After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of stomach pain, which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre. David was arrested and placed in prison twice, first from 2 August to 28 December 1794 and then from 29 May to 3 August 1795. Most of the time he served his sentence in the not uncomfortable Palais du Luxembourg in Paris. There he painted his own portrait, showing him much younger than he actually was, as well as that of his jailer.    Postrevolution   After Davids wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story of the rape of the Sabine women. The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running between the Combatants, also called The Intervention of the Sabine Women is said to have been painted to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution, especially since, in a private exhibition of the painting, the artist used a large mirror in his installation so that spectators could view themselves within the reflection of the work. David conceived a new style for this painting, one which he called the Pure Greek Style, as opposed to the Roman style of his earlier historical paintings. The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann. In Davids words, the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression. Instead of the muscularity and angularity of the figures of his past works, these were smoother, more feminine, and painterly. This work also brought him to the attention of Napoleon. The story for the painting is as follows The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines. To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediatelysince Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to Romulus, the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim. Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children. The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations. During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed. When David was finally released to the country, France had changed. His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her. He remarried her in 1796. Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part retired from politics. In August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by Quatremère de Quincy which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome. The Director Barras believed that David was tricked into signing, although one of Davids students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy.    Napoleon    Davids close association with the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror resulted in his signing of the death warrant for Alexandre de Beauharnais, a minor noble. Beauharnaiss widow, Joséphine, went on to marry Napoleon Bonaparte and became his empress David himself depicted their coronation in the Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, 2 December 1804.  David had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonapartes classical features. Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797. David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished. This was likely a decision by Napoleon himself after considering the current political situation. He may have considered the publicity the portrait would bring about to be illtimed. Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to Egypt in 1798, but David refused, seemingly unwilling to give up the material comfort, safety, and peace of mind he had obtained through the years. Draftsman and engraver Dominique Vivant Denon went to Egypt instead, providing mostly documentary and archaeological work. After Napoleons successful coup détat in 1799, as First Consul he commissioned David to commemorate his daring crossing of the Alps. The crossing of the St. Bernard Pass had allowed the French to surprise the Austrian army and win victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. Although Napoleon had crossed the Alps on a mule, he requested that he be portrayed calm upon a fiery steed. David complied with Napoleon Crossing the SaintBernard. After the proclamation of the Empire in 1804, David became the official court painter of the regime. During this period he took students, one of whom was the Belgian painter Pieter van Hanselaere.  One of the works David was commissioned for was The Coronation of Napoleon 18051807. David was permitted to watch the event. He had plans of Notre Dame delivered and participants in the coronation came to his studio to pose individually, though never the Emperor. The only time David obtained a sitting from Napoleon had been in 1797. David did manage to get a private sitting with the Empress Joséphine and Napoleons sister, Caroline Murat, through the intervention of erstwhile art patron Marshal Joachim Murat, the Emperors brotherinlaw. For his background, David had the choir of Notre Dame act as his fillin characters. Pope Pius VII came to sit for the painting, and actually blessed David. Napoleon came to see the painter, stared at the canvas for an hour and said David, I salute you. David had to redo several parts of the painting because of Napoleons various whims, and for this painting, he received twentyfour thousand Francs. David was made a Chevalier de la Légion dhonneur in 1803. He was promoted to an Officier in 1808. And, in 1815, he was promoted to a Commandant now Commandeur de la Légion dhonneur.    Exile and death   On the Bourbons returning to power, David figured in the list of proscribed former revolutionaries and Bonapartists for having voted execution for the deposed King Louis XVI and for participating in the death of Louis XVII, the deposed kings son who was mistreated, starved and forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie Antoinette, which contributed to her death sentence. The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter. David refused, preferring selfexile in Brussels. There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists such as FrançoisJoseph Navez and Ignace Brice, painted Cupid and Psyche and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife whom he had remarried. In that time, he painted smallerscale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic émigrés, such as the Baron Gerard. David created his last great work, Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces, from 1822 to 1824. In December 1823, he wrote This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventyfive years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush. The finished paintingevoking painted porcelain because of its limpid colorationwas exhibited first in Brussels, then in Paris, where his former students flocked to view it.    The exhibition was profitable13,000 francs, after deducting operating costs, thus, more than 10,000 people visited and viewed the painting. In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech. In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his The Anger of Achilles also known as the Sacrifice of Iphigenie the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. David remarked to his friends who visited his studio this painting is what is killing me such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the paintings merits. By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise FirminDidot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition Pour les grecs that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826.  When David was leaving a theater, the driver of a carriage struck him, and he later died, on 29 December 1825. At his death, some portraits were auctioned in Paris, they sold for little the famous Death of Marat was exhibited in a secluded room, to avoid outraging public sensibilities. Disallowed return to France for burial, for having been a regicide of King Louis XVI, the body of the painter JacquesLouis David was buried in Brussels and moved in 1882 to Brussels Cemetery, while some say his heart was buried with his wife at Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.    Freemasonry  The theme of the oath found in several works such as The Oath of the Tennis Court, The Distribution of the Eagles, and Leonidas at Thermopylae, was perhaps inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry. In 1989 during the David against David conference Albert Boime presented evidence, a document dated in 1787, showing the painters membership in the La Moderation Masonic Lodge.    Medical analysis of Davids face   JacquesLouis Davids facial abnormalities were traditionally reported to be a consequence of a deep facial sword wound after a fencing incident. These left him with a noticeable asymmetry during facial expression and resulted in his difficulty in eating or speaking. He could not pronounce some consonants such as the letter r. A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his selfportrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve. An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement. Furthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a benign tumor. These, however, may have been a granuloma, or even a posttraumatic neuroma. As historian Simon Schama has pointed out, witty banter and public speaking ability were key aspects of the social culture of 18thcentury France, so Davids tumor could have been a heavy obstacle in his social life. David was sometimes referred to as David of the Tumor.    Portraiture  In addition to his history paintings, David completed a number of privately commissioned portraits. Warren Roberts, among others, has pointed out the contrast between Davids public style of painting, as shown in his history paintings, and his private style, as shown in his portraits. His portraits were characterized by a sense of truth and realism. He focused on defining his subjects features and characters without idealizing them. This is different from the style seen in his historical paintings, in which he idealizes his figures features and bodies to align with Greek and Roman ideals of beauty. He puts a great deal of detail into his portraits, defining smaller features such as hands and fabric. The compositions of his portraits remain simple with blank backgrounds that allow the viewer to focus on the details of the subject. The portrait he did of his wife 1813 is an example of his typical portrait style. The background is dark and simple without any clues as to the setting, which forces the viewer to focus entirely on her. Her features are unidealized and truthful to her appearance. There is a great amount of detail that can be seen in his attention to portraying the satin material of the dress she wears, the drapery of the scarf around her, and her hands which rest in her lap.  In the painting of Brutus 1789, the man and his wife are separated, both morally and physically. Paintings such as these, depicting the great strength of patriotic sacrifice, made David a popular hero of the revolution. In the Portrait of AntoineLaurent Lavoisier and his wife 1788, the man and his wife are tied together in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interestLavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people. David, then a powerful member of the National Assembly, stood idly by and watched. Other portraits include paintings of his sisterinlaw and her husband, Madame and Monsieur Seriziat. The picture of Monsieur Seriziat depicts a man of wealth, sitting comfortably with his horseriding equipment. The picture of the Madame shows her wearing an unadorned white dress, holding her young childs hand as they lean against a bed. David painted these portraits of Madame and Monsieur Seriziat out of gratitude for letting him stay with them after he was in jail. Towards the end of Davids life, he painted a portrait of his old friend Abbé Sieyès. Both had been involved in the Revolution, both had survived the purging of political radicals that followed the reign of terror.    Shift in attitude  The shift in Davids perspective played an important role in the paintings of Davids later life, including this one of Sieyès. During the height of The Terror, David was an ardent supporter of radicals such as Robespierre and Marat, and twice offered up his life in their defense. He organized revolutionary festivals and painted portraits of martyrs of the revolution, such as Lepeletier, who was assassinated for voting for the death of the king. David was an impassioned speaker at times in the National Assembly. In speaking to the Assembly about the young boy named Bara, another martyr of the revolution, David said, O Bara O Viala The blood that you have spread still smokes it rises toward Heaven and cries for vengeance. After Robespierre was sent to the guillotine, however, David was imprisoned and changed the attitude of his rhetoric. During his imprisonment he wrote many letters, pleading his innocence. In one he wrote, I am prevented from returning to my atelier, which, alas, I should never have left. I believed that in accepting the most honorable position, but very difficult to fill, that of legislator, that a righteous heart would suffice, but I lacked the second quality, understanding. Later, while explaining his developing Grecian style for paintings such as The Intervention of the Sabine Women, David further commented on a shift in attitude In all human activity the violent and transitory develops first repose and profundity appear last. The recognition of these latter qualities requires time only great masters have them, while their pupils have access only to violent passions.    Legacy   JacquesLouis David was, in his time, regarded as the leading painter in France, and arguably all of Western Europe many of the painters honored by the restored Bourbons following the French Revolution had been Davids pupils. Davids student AntoineJean Gros for example, was made a Baron and honored by Napoleon Bonapartes court. Another pupil of Davids, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism. David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as JosephBenoît Suvée, who had also started teaching classes. To be one of Davids students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime reputation. He called on the more advanced students, such as JérômeMartin Langlois, to help him paint his large canvases. Musician and artist Therese Emilie Henriette Winkel painters Jean Baptiste Vermay and Benjamin de Rolland also studied with David. Despite Davids reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. Davids art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth. David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academys approach to art. Davids later works also reflect his growth in the development of the Empire style, notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from Davids opponents during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror. David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. One significant episode in Davids political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter Carle Vernet had approached David, requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items. David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed. Vernet allegedly blamed David for his sisters death, although he was not a member of the Committee of Public Safety or Committee of General Security, the two primary Committees responsible for enacting laws within the National Convention. In the last 50 years David has enjoyed a revival in popular favor and in 1948 his twohundredth birthday was celebrated with an exhibition at the Musée de lOrangerie in Paris and at Versailles showing his lifes works. Following World War II, JacquesLouis David was increasingly regarded as a symbol of French national pride and identity, as well as a vital force in the development of European and French art in the modern era. The birth of Romanticism is traditionally credited to the paintings of eighteenthcentury French artists such as JacquesLouis David. There are streets named after David in the French cities of Carcassonne and Montpellier.

"JeanAugusteDominique Ingres JeanAugusteDominique Ingres  ANGgrə French ʒɑ̃ oɡyst dɔminik ɛ̃ɡʁ 29 August 1780  14 January 1867 was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and JacquesLouis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and other modernists. Born into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his stylerevealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masterswas fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic. He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint, but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman. He was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824, when his Raphaelesque painting, The Vow of Louis XIII, was met with acclaim, and Ingres was acknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France. Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits, his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin marked his next popular success in 1833. The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835. He returned to Paris for good in 1841. In his later years he painted new versions of many of his earlier compositions, a series of designs for stained glass windows, several important portraits of women, and The Turkish Bath, the last of his several Orientalist paintings of the female nude, which he finished at the age of 83.    Early years Montauban and Toulouse  Ingres was born in Montauban, TarnetGaronne, France, the first of seven children five of whom survived infancy of JeanMarieJoseph Ingres 17551814 and his wife Anne Moulet 17581817. His father was a successful jackofalltrades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young Ingres received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a study after an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786, he attended the local school École des Frères de lÉducation Chrétienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and the closing of the school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity. In 1791, Joseph Ingres took his son to Toulouse, where the young JeanAugusteDominique was enrolled in the Académie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture. There he studied under the sculptor JeanPierre Vigan, the landscape painter Jean Briant, and the neoclassical painter GuillaumeJoseph Roques. Roques veneration of Raphael was a decisive influence on the young artist. Ingres won prizes in several disciplines, such as composition, figure and antique, and life studies. His musical talent was developed under the tutelage of the violinist Lejeune, and from the ages of thirteen to sixteen he played second violin in the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse. From an early age he was determined to be a history painter, which, in the hierarchy of genres established by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV, and continued well into the 19th Century, was considered the highest level of painting. He did not want to simply make portraits or illustrations of real life like his father he wanted to represent the heroes of religion, history and mythology, to idealize them and show them in ways that explained their actions, rivaling the best works of literature and philosophy.    In Paris 17971806   In March 1797, the Academy awarded Ingres first prize in drawing, and in August he traveled to Paris to study in the studio of JacquesLouis David, Francesand Europesleading painter during the revolutionary period, in whose studio he remained for four years. Ingres followed his masters neoclassical example. In 1797 David was working on his enormous masterpiece, The Intervention of the Sabine Women, and was gradually modifying his style away from Roman models of rigorous realism to the ideals of purity, virtue and simplicity in Greek art.   One of the other students of David, ÉtienneJean Delécluze, who later became an art critic, described Ingres as a student He was distinguished not just by the candor of his character and his disposition to work alone ... he was one of the most studious ... he took little part in the all the turbulent follies around him, and he studied with more perseverance than most of his codisciples ... All of the qualities which characterize today the talent of this artist, the finesse of contour, the true and profound sentiment of the form, and a modeling with extraordinary correctness and firmness, could already be seen in his early studies. While several of his comrades and David himself signaled a tendency toward exaggeration in his studies, everyone was struck by his grand compositions and recognized his talent. He was admitted to the painting department of the École des BeauxArts in October 1799. In 1800 and 1801, he won the grand prize for figure painting for his paintings of male torsos.  In 1800 and 1801, he competed for the Prix de Rome, the highest prize of the Academy, which entitled the winner to four years of residence at the French Academy in Rome. He came in second in his first attempt, but in 1801 he took the top prize with The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. The figures of the envoys, in the right of the painting, are muscular and solid as statues, in the style taught by David, but the two main figures on the left, Achilles and Patroclus, are mobile, vivid and graceful, like figures in a delicate basrelief.  His residence in Rome was postponed until 1806 due to shortage of state funds. In the meantime he worked in Paris alongside several other students of David in a studio provided by the state, and further developed a style that emphasized purity of contour. He found inspiration in the works of Raphael, in Etruscan vase paintings, and in the outline engravings of the English artist John Flaxman. His drawings of Hermaphrodite and the Nymph Salmacis showed a new stylized ideal of female beauty, which would reappear later in his Jupiter et Thetis and his famous nudes. In 1802 he made his debut at the Salon with Portrait of a Woman the current whereabouts of which is unknown. Between 1804 and 1806 he painted a series of portraits which were striking for their extreme precision, particularly in the richness of their fabrics and tiny details. These included the Portrait of Philipbert Riviére 1805, Portrait of Sabine Rivière 180506, Portrait of Madame Aymon also known as La Belle Zélie 1806, and Portrait of Caroline Rivière 180506. The female faces were not at all detailed but were softened, and were notable for their large oval eyes and delicate flesh colours and their rather dreamlike expressions. His portraits typically had simple backgrounds of solid dark or light colour, or of sky. These were the beginning of a series that would make him among the most celebrated portrait artists of the 19th century. As Ingres waited to depart to Rome, his friend Lorenzo Bartolini introduced him to Italian Renaissance paintings, particularly the works of Bronzino and Pontormo, which Napoleon had brought back from his campaign in Italy and placed in the Louvre. Ingres assimilated their clarity and monumentality into his own portrait style. In the Louvre were also masterpieces of Flemish art, including the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck, which the French army had seized during its conquest of Flanders. The precision of Renaissance Flemish art became part of Ingress style. Ingress stylistic eclecticism represented a new tendency in art. The Louvre, newly filled with booty seized by Napoleon in his campaigns in Italy and the Low Countries, provided French artists of the early 19th century with an unprecedented opportunity to study, compare, and copy masterworks from antiquity and from the entire history of European painting. As art historian Marjorie Cohn has written At the time, art history as a scholarly enquiry was brandnew. Artists and critics outdid each other in their attempts to identify, interpret, and exploit what they were just beginning to perceive as historical stylistic developments. From the beginning of his career, Ingres freely borrowed from earlier art, adopting the historical style appropriate to his subject, and was consequently accused by critics of plundering the past.  In 1803 he received a prestigious commission, being one of five artists selected along with JeanBaptiste Greuze, Robert Lefèvre, Charles Meynier, and MarieGuillemine Benoist to paint fulllength portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul. These were to be distributed to the prefectural towns of Liège, Antwerp, Dunkerque, Brussels, and Ghent, all of which were newly ceded to France in the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville. Napoleon is not known to have granted the artists a sitting, and Ingress meticulously painted portrait of Bonaparte, First Consul appears to be modelled on an image of Napoleon painted by AntoineJean Gros in 1802.  In the summer of 1806, Ingres became engaged to MarieAnneJulie Forestier, a painter and musician, before leaving for Rome in September. Although he had hoped to stay in Paris long enough to witness the opening of that years Salon, in which he was to display several works, he reluctantly left for Italy just days before the opening. Ingres painted a new portrait of Napoleon for presentation at the Salon of 1806, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation. This painting was entirely different from his earlier portrait of Napoleon as First Consul it concentrated almost entirely on the lavish imperial costume that Napoleon had chosen to wear, and the symbols of power he held. The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail the Emperors face and hands were almost lost in the majestic costume.  At the Salon, his paintingsSelfPortrait, portraits of the Rivière family, and Napoleon I on his Imperial Thronereceived a very chilly reception. David delivered a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard Le Pausanias Français, 1806 praised the fineness of Ingress brushwork and the finish, but condemned Ingress style as gothic and asked How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture The answer is that he wanted to do something singular, something extraordinary ... M. Ingress intention is nothing less than to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.    Rome and the French Academy 18061814   Newly arrived in Rome, Ingres read with mounting indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings sent to him from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective fatherinlaw, he expressed his outrage at the critics So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace ... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation ... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which dont in any way resemble theirs and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine. He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry. On 23 November 1806, he wrote to Jean Forestier, the father of his former fiancée, Yes, art will need to be reformed, and I intend to be that revolutionary. Characteristically, he found a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici away from the other resident artists, and painted furiously. Many drawings of monuments in Rome from this time are attributed to Ingres, but it appears from more recent scholarship that they were actually the work of his collaborators, particularly his friend the landscape artist FrançoisMarius Granet. As required of every winner of the Prix, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. Traditionally fellows sent paintings of male Greek or Roman heroes, but for his first samples Ingres sent Baigneuse à micorps 1807, a painting of the back of a young woman bathing, based on an engraving of an antique vase, and La Grande Bagneuse 1808, a larger painting of the back of a nude bather, and the first Ingres model to wear a turban, a detail he borrowed from the Fornarina by his favourite painter, Raphael. To satisfy the Academy in Paris, he also dispatched Oedipus and the Sphinx to show his mastery of the male nude. The verdict of the academicians in Paris was that the figures were not sufficiently idealized. In later years Ingres painted several variants of these compositions another nude begun in 1807, the Venus Anadyomene, remained in an unfinished state for decades, to be completed forty years later and finally exhibited in 1855.  During his time in Rome he also painted numerous portraits Madame Duvaucey 1807, FrançoisMarius Granet 1807, JosephAntoine Moltedo 1810, Madame Panckoucke 1811, and CharlesJosephLaurent Cordier 1811. In 1812 he painted one of his few portraits of an older woman, Comtesse de Tournon, mother of the prefect of Rome. In 1810 Ingress pension at the Villa Medici ended, but he decided to stay in Rome and seek patronage from the French occupation government. In 1811 Ingres completed his final student exercise, the immense Jupiter and Thetis, a scene from the Iliad of Homer the goddess of the Sea, Thetis, pleads with Zeus to act in favor of her son Achilles. The face of the water nymph Salmacis he had drawn years earlier reappeared as Thetis. Ingres wrote with enthusiasm that he had been planning to paint this subject since 1806, and he intended to deploy all of the luxury of art in its beauty. However, once again, the critics were hostile, finding fault with the exaggerated proportions of the figures and the paintings flat, airless quality. Although facing uncertain prospects, in 1813 Ingres married a young woman, Madeleine Chapelle, recommended to him by her friends in Rome. After a courtship carried out through correspondence, he proposed without having met her, and she accepted. Their marriage was happy, and Madame Ingress faith in her husband was unwavering. After a difficult childbirth in 1815 resulted in a stillborn baby, the couple remained childless. Ingres continued to suffer disparaging reviews, as Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IVs Sword, Raphael and the Fornarina Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, several portraits, and the Interior of the Sistine Chapel met with generally hostile critical response at the Paris Salon of 1814.    Rome after the Academy and Florence 18141824   After he left the Academy, a few important commissions came to him. The French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, asked him to decorate rooms of the Monte Cavallo Palace, a former papal residence, for an expected visit of Napoleon. Ingres painted a largescale Romulus Victory Over Acron 1811 for the salon of the Empress and The Dream of Ossian 1813, based on a book of poems that Napoleon admired, for the ceiling of the Emperors bedroom. General Miollis also commissioned Ingres to paint Virgil reading The Aeneid before Augustus, Livia and Octavia 1812 for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini. The painting shows the moment when Virgil, reciting his work to the Emperor Augustus, his wife Livia and his sister Octavia, mentions the name of Octavias dead son, Marcellus, causing Octavia to faint. The interior was precisely depicted, following the archeological finds at Pompeii. As usual, Ingres made several versions of the same scene a threefigure fragment cut from an abandoned version is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in 1825 he made a chalk drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving made by Pradier in 1832. The General Miollis version was repurchased by Ingres in the 1830s, reworked by assistants under Ingress direction, and never finished The Dream of Ossian was likewise repurchased, modified, but left unfinished. He traveled to Naples in the spring of 1814 to paint Queen Caroline Murat. Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, had earlier purchased the Dormeuse de Naples, a sleeping nude the original is lost, but several drawings exist, and Ingres later revisited the subject in LOdalisque à lesclave. Murat also commissioned two historical paintings, Raphael et la Fornarina and Paolo et Francesca, and what later became one of Ingress most famous works, La Grande Odalisque, to accompany Dormeuse de Naples. Ingres never received payment, due to the collapse of the Murat regime and execution of Joachim Murat in 1815. With the fall of Napoleons dynasty, he found himself essentially stranded in Rome without patronage.  He continued to produce masterful portraits, in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision but with the departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome. For an artist who aspired to a reputation as a history painter, this seemed menial work, and to the visitors who knocked on his door asking, Is this where the man who draws the little portraits lives, he would answer with irritation, No, the man who lives here is a painter The portrait drawings he produced in such profusion during this period rank today among his most admired works. He is estimated to have made some five hundred portrait drawings, including portraits of his famous friends. His friends included many musicians including Paganini, and he regularly played the violin with others who shared his enthusiasm for Mozart, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven. He also produced a series of small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted Aretino and Charles Vs Ambassador as well as Aretino and Tintoretto, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included Henry IV Playing with His Children 1817 and the Death of Leonardo.  In 1816 Ingres produced his only etching, a portrait of the French ambassador to Rome, Monsignor Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny. The only other prints he is known to have executed are two lithographs The Four Magistrates of Besançon, made as an illustration for Baron Taylors Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans lancienne France, and a copy of La Grande Odalisque, both in 1825. In 1817 the Count of Blacas, who was ambassador of France to the Holy See, provided Ingres with his first official commission since 1814, for a painting of Christ Giving the Keys to Peter. Completed in 1820, this imposing work was well received in Rome but to the artists chagrin the ecclesiastical authorities there would not permit it to be sent to Paris for exhibition. A commission came in 1816 or 1817 from the descendants of the Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, for a painting of the Duke receiving papal honours for his repression of the Protestant Reformation. Ingres loathed the subjecthe regarded the Duke as one of historys brutesand struggled to satisfy both the commission and his conscience. After revisions which eventually reduced the Duke to a tiny figure in the background, Ingres left the work unfinished. He entered in his diary, Jetais forcé par la necessité de peindre un pareil tableau Dieu a voulu quil reste en ebauche. I was forced by need to paint such a painting God wanted it to remain a sketch.  He continued to send works to the Salon in Paris, hoping to make his breakthrough there. In 1819 he sent his reclining nude, La Grande Odalisque, as well as a history painting, Philip V and the Marshal of Berwick, and Roger Freeing Angelica, based on an episode in the 16thcentury epic poem Orlando Furioso by Ariosto but his work was once again condemned by critics as gothic and unnatural. The critic Kératy complained that the Grande Odalisques back was three vertebrae too long. The critic Charles Landon wrote After a moment of attention, one sees that in this figure there are no bones, no muscles, no blood, no life, no relief, no anything which constitutes imitation....it is evident that the artist deliberately erred, that he wanted to do it badly, that he believed in bringing back to life the pure and primitive manner of the painters of Antiquity but he took for his model a few fragments from earlier periods and a degenerate execution, and completely lost his way. In 1820 Ingres and his wife moved to Florence at the urging of the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, an old friend from his years in Paris. He still had to depend upon his portraits and drawings for income, but his luck began to change. His history painting Roger Freeing Angelica was purchased for the private collection of Louis XVIII, and was hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris, which was newly devoted to the work of living artists. This was the first work of Ingres to enter a museum.  In 1821, he finished a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V de Pastoret also ordered a portrait of himself and a religious work Virgin with the Blue Veil. In August 1820, with the help of de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the reestablishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingress painting, The Vow of Louis XIII 1824, inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, and he took it to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it became the key that finally opened the door of the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.    Return to Paris and retreat to Rome 18241834   The Vow of Louis XIII in the Salon of 1824 finally brought Ingres critical success. Although Stendhal complained about the sort of material beauty which excludes the idea of divinity, most critics praised the work. The journalist and future Prime Minister and French President Adolphe Thiers celebrated the breakthrough of a new style Nothing is better than variety like this, the essential character of the new style. In January 1825 Ingres was awarded the Cross of the Légion dhonneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected a member of Académie des BeauxArts. Lithographs of La Grande Odalisque published in 1826 in two competing versions by Delpech and Sudré found eager buyers Ingres received 24,000 francs for the reproduction rights  twenty times the amount he had been paid for the original painting six years earlier. The 1824 Salon also brought forward a countercurrent to the neoclassicism of Ingres Eugène Delacroix exhibited Les Massacres de Scio, in a romantic style sharply contrasting to that of Ingres. The success of Ingress painting led in 1826 to a major new commission, The Apotheosis of Homer, a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling of one of the halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingress Apotheosis and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus. Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm he called Delacroix the apostle of ugliness and told friends that he recognized the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit of Delacroix, but that he has tendencies which I believe are dangerous and which I must push back.  Despite the considerable patronage he enjoyed under the Bourbon government, Ingres welcomed the July Revolution of 1830. That the outcome of the Revolution was not a republic but a constitutional monarchy was satisfactory to the essentially conservative and pacifistic artist, who in a letter to a friend in August 1830 criticized agitators who still want to soil and disturb the order and happiness of a freedom so gloriously, so divinely won. Ingress career was little affected, and he continued to receive official commissions and honors under the July Monarchy. Ingres exhibited in the Salon of 1833, where his portrait of LouisFrançois Bertin 1832 was a particular success. The public found its realism spellbinding, although some of the critics declared its naturalism vulgar and its colouring drab. In 1834 he finished a large religious painting, The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian, which depicted the first saint to be martyred in Gaul. The painting was commissioned in 1824 by the Ministry of the Interior for the Cathedral of Autun, and the iconography in the picture was specified by the bishop. Ingres conceived the painting as the summation of all of his work and skill, and worked on it for ten years before displaying it at the Salon of 1834. He was surprised, shocked and angered by the response the painting was attacked by both the neoclassicists and by the romantics. Ingres was accused of historical inaccuracy, for the colours, and for the feminine appearance of the Saint, who looked like a beautiful statue. In anger, Ingres announced that he would no longer accept public commissions, and that he would no longer participate in the Salon. He later did participate in some semipublic expositions and a retrospective of his work at the 1855 Paris International Exposition, but never again took part in the Salon or submitted his work for public judgement. Instead, at the end of 1834 he returned to Rome to become the Director of the Academy of France.    Director of the French Academy in Rome 18341841  Ingres remained in Rome for six years. He devoted much of his attention to the training of the painting students, as he was later to do at the École des BeauxArts in Paris. He reorganized the Academy, increased the size of the library, added many molds of classical statues to the Academy collection, and assisted the students in getting public commissions in both Rome and Paris. He traveled to Orvieto 1835, Siena 1835, and to Ravenna and Urbino to study the paleochristian mosaics, medieval murals and Renaissance art. He devoted considerable attention to music, one of the subjects of the academy he welcomed Franz Liszt and Fanny Mendelssohn. He formed a long friendship with Liszt. Composer Charles Gounod, who was a pensioner at the time at the Academy, described Ingress appreciation of modern music, including Weber and Berlioz, and his adoration for Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Gluck. He joined the music students and his friend Niccolò Paganini in playing Beethovens violin works. Gounod wrote that Ingres had the tenderness of an infant and the indignation of an apostle. When Stendhal visited the Academy and disparaged Beethoven, Ingres turned to the doorman, indicated Stendhal, and told him, If this gentleman ever calls again, I am not here. His rancor against the Paris art establishment for his failure at the 1834 Salon did not abate. In 1836 he refused a major commission from the French Minister of the Interior, Adolphe Thiers, to decorate the interior of the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, because the commission had been offered first to a rival, Paul Delaroche, who refused it. He did complete a small number of works which he sent to patrons in Paris. One was LOdalisque et lesclave, 1839, a portrait of a blonde odalisque, or member of a harem, who reclines languorously while a turbaned musician plays. This fitted into the popular genre of orientalism his rival Eugène Delacroix had created a painting on a similar theme, Les Femmes dAlger, for the 1834 Salon. The setting was inspired by Persian miniatures and was full of exotic detail, but the womans long reclining form was pure Ingres. The critic Théophile Gautier wrote of Ingress work It is impossible to better paint the mystery, the silence and the suffocating atmosphere of the seraglio. In 1842 he painted a second version, nearly identical to the first but with a landscape background painted by his student Paul Flandrin.  The second painting he sent, in 1840, was The Illness of Antiochus 1840 also known as Aniochus and Stratonice a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. It was commissioned by the Duc dOrleans, the son of King Louis Philippe I, and had very elaborate architectural background designed by one of the Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in a pastel robe, whose contemplative pose with her hand on her chin recurs in some of Ingress female portraits. His painting of Aniochius and Stratonice, despite its small size, just one meter, was a major success for Ingres. In August it was shown in the private apartment of the duc dOrléans in the Pavilion Marsan of the Palais des Tuileries. The King greeted him personally at Versailles and gave him a tour of the Palace. He was offered a commission to paint a portrait of the Duke, the heir to the throne, and another from the Duc de Lunyes to create two huge murals for the Château de Dampierre. In April 1841 he returned definitively to Paris.    Last years 18411867   One of the first works executed after his return to Paris was a portrait of the duc dOrléans. After the heir to the throne was killed in a carriage accident a few months after the painting was completed in 1842, Ingres received commissions to make additional copies. He also received a commission to design seventeen stained glass windows for the chapel on the place where the accident occurred, and a commission for eight additional stainedglass designs for Orléans chapel in Dreux. He became a professor at the Ecole des BeauxArts in Paris. He took his students frequently to the Louvre to the see the classical and Renaissance art, instructing them to look straight ahead and to avoid the works of Rubens, which he believed deviated too far from the true values of art. The Revolution of 1848, which overthrew Louis Philippe and created the French Second Republic, had little effect on his work or his ideas. He declared that the revolutionaries were cannibals who called themselves French, but during the Revolution completed his Venus Anadyomene, which he had started as an academic study in 1808. It represented Venus, rising from the sea which had given birth to her, surrounded by cherubs. He welcomed the patronage of the new government of LouisNapoleon, who in 1852 became Emperor Napoleon III.  In 1843 Ingres began the decorations of the great hall in the Château de Dampierre with two large murals, the Golden Age and the Iron Age, illustrating the origins of art. He made more than five hundred preparatory drawings, and worked on the enormous project for six years. In an attempt to imitate the effect of Renaissance frescos, he chose to paint the murals in oil on plaster, which created technical difficulties. Work on the Iron Age never progressed beyond the architectural background painted by an assistant. Meanwhile, the growing crowd of nudes in the Golden Age discomfited Ingress patron, the Duc de Luynes, and Ingres suspended work on the mural in 1847. Ingres was devastated by the loss of his wife, who died on 27 July 1849, and he was finally unable to complete the work. In July 1851, he announced a gift of his artwork to his native city of Montauban, and in October he resigned as professor at the École des BeauxArts. However, in 1852, Ingres, then seventyone years of age, married fortythreeyearold Delphine Ramel, a relative of his friend Marcotte dArgenteuil. Ingres was rejuvenated, and in the decade that followed he completed several significant works, including the portrait of Princesse Albert de Broglie, née JoséphineEléonoreMariePauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn. In 1853 he began the Apotheosis of Napoleon I, for the ceiling of a hall in the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. It was destroyed in May 1871 when the Paris Commune set fire to the building. With the help of assistants, in 1854 he completed another history painting, Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII. A retrospective of his works was featured at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, and in the same year Napoleon III named him a Grand Officer of the Légion dhonneur. In 1862 he was awarded the title of Senator, and made a member of the Imperial Council on Public Instruction. Three of his works were shown in the London International Exhibition, and his reputation as a major French painter was confirmed once more.  He continued to rework and refine his classic themes. In 1856 Ingres completed The Source The Spring, a painting begun in 1820 and closely related to his Venus Anadyoméne. He painted two versions of Louis XIV and Molière 1857 and 1860, and produced variant copies of several of his earlier compositions. These included religious works in which the figure of the Virgin from The Vow of Louis XIII was reprised The Virgin of the Adoption of 1858 painted for Mademoiselle RolandGosselin was followed by The Virgin Crowned painted for Madame la Baronne de Larinthie and The Virgin with Child. In 1859 he produced new versions of The Virgin of the Host, and in 1862 he completed Christ and the Doctors, a work commissioned many years before by Queen Marie Amalie for the chapel of Bizy. He painted small replicas of Paolo and Francesca and Oedipus and the Sphinx. In 1862 he completed a small oilonpaper version of The Golden Age. The last of his important portrait paintings date from this period MarieClothildeInés de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier, Seated 1856, SelfPortrait at the Age of Seventyeight and Madame J.A.D. Ingres, née Delphine Ramel, both completed in 1859. At the request of the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, he made his ownself portrait in 1858. The only colour in the painting is the red of his rosette of the Legion of Honour. Near the end of his life, he made one of his bestknown masterpieces, The Turkish Bath. It reprised a figure and theme he had been painting since 1828, with his Petite Baigneuse. Originally completed in a square format in 1852 and sold to Prince Napoleon in 1859, it was returned to the artist soon afterwardaccording to a legend, Princess Clothilde was shocked by the abundant nudity. After reworking the painting as a tondo, Ingres signed and dated it in 1862, although he made additional revisions in 1863. The painting was eventually purchased by a Turkish diplomat, Khalid Bey, who owned a large collection of nudes and erotic art, including several paintings by Courbet. The painting continued to cause a scandal long after Ingres was dead. It was initially offered to the Louvre in 1907, but was rejected, before being given to the Louvre in 1911. Ingres died of pneumonia on 14 January 1867, at the age of eightysix, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. He is interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with a tomb sculpted by his student JeanMarie Bonnassieux. The contents of his studio, including a number of major paintings, over 4000 drawings, and his violin, were bequeathed by the artist to the city museum of Montauban, now known as the Musée Ingres.    Style   Ingress style was formed early in life and changed comparatively little. His earliest drawings, such as the Portrait of a Man or Portrait of an unknown, 3 July 1797, now in the Louvre already show a suavity of outline and an extraordinary control of the parallel hatchings which model the forms. From the first, his paintings are characterized by a firmness of outline reflecting his oftenquoted conviction that drawing is the probity of art. He believed colour to be no more than an accessory to drawing, explaining Drawing is not just reproducing contours, it is not just the line drawing is also the expression, the inner form, the composition, the modelling. See what is left after that. Drawing is seven eighths of what makes up painting. The art historian Jean Clay said Ingres proceeded always from certitude to certitude, with the result that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works. In depicting the human body he disregarded rules of anatomywhich he termed a dreadful science that I cannot think of without disgustin his quest for a sinuous arabesque. Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the Romantic school depended he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. Ce que lon sait, he would repeat, il faut le savoir lépée à la main. Whatever you know, you must know it with sword in hand. Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the Apotheosis of Homer and the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian. Among Ingress historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as Oedipus, The HalfLength Bather, Odalisque, and The Spring, subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical wellbeing. In Roger Freeing Angelica, the female nude seems merely juxtaposed with the meticulously rendered but inert figure of Roger flying to the rescue on his hippogriff, for Ingres was rarely successful in the depiction of movement and drama. According to Sanford Schwartz, the historical, mythological, and religious pictures bespeak huge amounts of energy and industry, but, conveying little palpable sense of inner tension, are costume dramas ... The faces in the history pictures are essentially those of models waiting for the session to be over. When an emotion is to be expressed, it comes across stridently, or woodenly. Ingres was averse to theories, and his allegiance to classicismwith its emphasis on the ideal, the generalized, and the regularwas tempered by his love of the particular. He believed that the secret of beauty has to be found through truth. The ancients did not create, they did not make they recognized. In many of Ingress works there is a collision between the idealized and the particular that creates what Robert Rosenblum termed an oilandwater sensation. This contradiction is vivid in Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry 1842, for example, in which the realistically painted 81yearold composer is attended by an idealized muse in classical drapery. Ingress choice of subjects reflected his literary tastes, which were severely limited he read and reread Homer, Virgil, Plutarch, Dante, histories, and the lives of the artists. Throughout his life he revisited a small number of favourite themes, and painted multiple versions of many of his major compositions. He did not share his ages enthusiasm for battle scenes, and generally preferred to depict moments of revelation or intimate decision manifested by meeting or confrontation, but never by violence. His numerous odalisque paintings were influenced to a great extent by the writings of Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the ambassador to Turkey whose diaries and letters, when published, fascinated European society. Although capable of painting quickly, he often laboured for years over a painting. Ingress pupil AmauryDuval wrote of him With this facility of execution, one has trouble explaining why Ingres oeuvre is not still larger, but he scraped out his work frequently, never being satisfied ... and perhaps this facility itself made him rework whatever dissatisfied him, certain that he had the power to repair the fault, and quickly, too. Ingress Venus Anadyomene was begun in 1807 but not completed until 1848, after a long hiatus resulting from his indecision about the position of the arms. The Source 1856 had a similar history. It was begun in the 1820s as a sketch of such simplicity that one would suppose she had been painted in a single stroke according to AmauryDuval, who believed that Ingres reworking of the painting in 1855 was a loss.    Portraits   While Ingres believed that history painting was the highest form of art, his modern reputation rests largely upon the exceptional quality of his portraits. By the time of his retrospective at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, an emerging consensus viewed his portrait paintings as his masterpieces. Their consistently high quality belies Ingress oftenstated complaint that the demands of portraiture robbed him of time he could have spent painting historical subjects. Baudelaire called him the sole man in France who truly makes portraits. The portraits of M. Bertin, M. Molé and Mme dHaussonville are true portraits, that is, the ideal reconstruction of individuals....A good portrait seems to me always as a biography dramatized. His most famous portrait is that of LouisFrançois Bertin, the chief editor of the Journal des Debats, which was widely admired when it was exhibited at the 1833 Salon. Ingres had originally planned to paint Bertin standing, but many hours of effort ended in a creative impasse before he decided on a seated pose. Édouard Manet described the resulting portrait as The Buddha of the Bourgeoisie. The portrait quickly became a symbol of the rising economic and political power of Bertins social class. For his female portraits, he often posed the subject after a classical statue the famous portrait of the Comtesse deHaussonville may have been modeled after a Roman statue called Pudicity modesty in the Vatican collection. Another trick that Ingres used was to paint the fabrics and details in the portraits with extreme precision and accuracy, but to idealize the face. The eye of the viewer would perceive the fabrics as realistic and would assume the face was equally true. His portraits of women range from the warmly sensuous Madame de Senonnes 1814 to the realistic Mademoiselle Jeanne Gonin 1821, the Junoesque MarieClothildeInés de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier portrayed standing and seated, 1851 and 1856, and the chilly JoséphineEléonoreMariePauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn, Princesse de Broglie 1853.    Drawings   Drawing was the foundation of Ingress art. In the Ecole des BeauxArts he excelled at figure drawing, winning the top prizes. During his years in Rome and Florence, he made hundreds of drawings of family, friends, and visitors, many of them of very high portrait quality. He never began a painting without first resolving the drawing, usually with a long series of drawing in which he refined the composition. In the case of his large history paintings, each figure in the painting was the subject of numerous sketches and studies as he tried different poses. He demanded that his students at the Academy and the Ecole des BeauxArts perfect their drawing before anything else he declared that a thing well drawn is always a thing well painted.  His portrait drawings, of which about 450 are extant, are today among his most admired works. While a disproportionate number of them date from his difficult early years in Italy, he continued to produce portrait drawings of his friends until the end of his life. Agnes Mongan has written of the portrait drawingsBefore his departure in the fall of 1806 from Paris for Rome, the familiar characteristics of his drawing style were well established, the delicate yet firm contour, the definite yet discreet distortions of form, the almost uncanny capacity to seize a likeness in the precise yet lively delineation of features.The preferred materials were also already established the sharply pointed graphite pencil on a smooth white paper. So familiar to us are both the materials and the manner that we forget how extraordinary they must have seemed at the time ... Ingres manner of drawing was as new as the century. It was immediately recognized as expert and admirable. If his paintings were sternly criticized as Gothic, no comparable criticism was leveled at his drawings. His student Raymond Balze described Ingress working routine in executing his portrait drawings, each of which required four hours, as an hour and a half in the morning, then twoandahalf hours in the afternoon, he very rarely retouched it the next day. He often told me that he got the essence of the portrait while lunching with the model who, off guard, became more natural. The resulting drawings, according to John Canaday, revealed the sitters personalities by means so subtleand so free of crueltythat Ingres could expose the vanities of a fop, a silly woman, or a windbag, in drawings that delighted them. Ingres drew his portrait drawings on wove paper, which provided a smooth surface very different from the ribbed surface of laid paper which is, nevertheless, sometimes referred to today as Ingres paper. The early drawings are characterized by very taut contours drawn with sharply pointed graphite, while later drawings show freer lines and more emphatic modeling, drawn with a softer, blunter graphite. Drawings made in preparation for paintings, such as the many studies for The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian and The Golden Age, are more varied in size and treatment than are the portrait drawings. It was his usual practice to make many drawings of nude models, in search of the most eloquent gesture, before making another series of drawings for the draperies. In his early years he sometimes had his model pose behind a translucent veil that suppressed details and emphasized the arabesque. He often used female models when testing poses for male figures, as he did in drawings for Jesus Among the Doctors. Nude studies exist even for some of his commissioned portraits, but these were drawn using hired models. Ingres drew a number of landscape views while in Rome, but he painted only one pure landscape, the small tondo Raphaels Casino although two other small landscape tondos are sometimes attributed to him.    Colour  For Ingres, colour played an entirely secondary role in art. He wrote, Colour adds ornament to a painting but it is nothing but the handmaiden, because all it does is to render more agreeable the true perfections of the art. Rubens and Van Dyck can be pleasing at first sight, but they are deceptive they are from the poor school of colourists, the school of deception. Never use bright colours, they are antihistoric. It is better to fall into gray than to into bright colours. The Institute in Paris complained in 1838 that the students of Ingres in Rome had a deplorable lack of knowledge of the truth and power of colour, and a knowledge of the different effects of light. A dull and opaque effect is found in all their canvases. They seem to have only been lit by twilight. The poet and critic Baudelaire observed the students of M. Ingres have very uselessly avoided any semblance of colour they believe or pretend to believe that they are not needed in painting. Ingress own paintings vary considerably in their use of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelairewho said M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable millinerwrote of the portraits of LouisFrançois Bertin and Madame dHaussonville Open your eyes, nation of simpletons, and tell us if you ever saw such dazzling, eyecatching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour. Ingress paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the acid blues and bottle greens Kenneth Clark professed to perversely enjoy in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle JeanneSuzanneCatherine Gonin 1821, colour is restrained.    Ingres and Delacroix  Ingres and Delacroix became, in the mid19th century, the most prominent representatives of the two competing schools of art in France, neoclassicism and romanticism. Neoclassicism was based in large part on the philosophy of Johann Joachim Winckelmann 17171768, who wrote that art should embody noble simplicity and calm grandeur. Many painters followed this course, including François Gérard, AntoineJean Gros, AnneLouis Girodet, and JacquesLouis David, the teacher of Ingres. A competing school, romanticism, emerged first in Germany, and moved quickly to France. It rejected the idea of the imitation of classical styles, which it described as gothic and primitive. The Romanticists in French painting were led by Théodore Géricault and especially Delacroix. The rivalry first emerged at the Paris Salon of 1824, where Ingres exhibited The Vow of Louis XIII, inspired by Raphael, while Delacroix showed The Massacre at Chios, depicting a tragic event in the Greek War of Independence. Ingress painting was calm, static and carefully constructed, while the work of Delacroix was turbulent, full of motion, colour, and emotion. The dispute between the two painters and schools reappeared at the 1827 Salon, where Ingres presented LApotheose dHomer, an example of classical balance and harmony, while Delacroix showed The Death of Sardanapalus, another glittering and tumultuous scene of violence. The duel between the two painters, each considered the best of his school, continued over the years. Paris artists and intellectuals were passionately divided by the conflict, although modern art historians tend to regard Ingres and other Neoclassicists as embodying the Romantic spirit of their time. At the 1855 Universal Exposition, both Delacroix and Ingres were well represented. The supporters of Delacroix and the romantics heaped abuse on the work of Ingres. The Brothers Goncourt described the miserly talent of Ingres Faced with history, M. Ingres calls vainly to his assistance a certain wisdom, decency, convenience, correction and a reasonable dose of the spiritual elevation that a graduate of a college demands. He scatters persons around the center of the action ... tosses here and there an arm, a leg, a head perfectly drawn, and thinks that his job is done... Baudelaire also, previously sympathetic toward Ingres, shifted toward Delacroix. M. Ingres can be considered a man gifted with high qualities, an eloquent evoker of beauty, but deprived of the energetic temperament which creates the fatality of genius. Delacroix himself was merciless toward Ingres. Describing the exhibition of works by Ingres at the 1855 Exposition, he called it ridiculous ... presented, as one knows, in a rather pompous fashion ... It is the complete expression of an incomplete intelligence effort and pretension are everywhere nowhere is there found a spark of the natural. According to Ingres student Paul Chenavard, later in their careers, Ingres and Delacroix accidentally met on the steps of the French Institute Ingres put his hand out, and the two shook amicably.    Pupils  Ingres was a conscientious teacher and was greatly admired by his students. The best known of them is Théodore Chassériau, who studied with him from 1830, as a precocious elevenyearold, until Ingres closed his studio in 1834 to return to Rome. Ingres considered Chassériau his truest discipleeven predicting, according to an early biographer, that he would be the Napoleon of painting.  By the time Chassériau visited Ingres in Rome in 1840, however, the younger artists growing allegiance to the romantic style of Delacroix was apparent, leading Ingres to disown his favourite student, of whom he subsequently spoke rarely and censoriously. No other artist who studied under Ingres succeeded in establishing a strong identity among the most notable of them were JeanHippolyte Flandrin, Henri Lehmann, and Eugène Emmanuel AmauryDuval.    Influence on modern art   Ingress influence on later generations of artists was considerable. One of his heirs was Degas, who studied under Louis Lamothe, a minor disciple of Ingres. In the 20th century, his influence was even stronger. Picasso and Matisse were among those who acknowledged a debt to Ingres Matisse described him as the first painter to use pure colours, outlining them without distorting them. The startling effects of Ingress paintingsthe collapsing of traditional depth and perspective and the presentation of figures like the figures in a deck of cardswere criticized in the 19th century but were welcomed by the avantgarde in the 20th century. An important retrospective of works by Ingres was held at the Salon dautomne in Paris in 1905, which was visited by Picasso, Matisse, and many other artists. The original and striking composition of The Turkish Bath, shown for the first time in public, had a visible influence on the composition and poses of the figures in Picassos Les Demoiselles dAvignon in 1907. The exhibit also included many of his studies for the unfinished mural lAge dor, including a striking drawing of women gracefully dancing in a circle. Matisse produced his own version on this composition in his painting La Danse in 1909. The particular pose and colouring of Ingress Portrait of Monsieur Bertin also made a reappearance in Picassos Portrait of Gertrude Stein 1906. Barnett Newman credited Ingres as a progenitor of abstract expressionism, explaining That guy was an abstract painter ... He looked at the canvas more often than at the model. Kline, de Kooningnone of us would have existed without him.  Pierre Barousse, the curator of the Musée Ingres, wrote ...One realizes in how many ways a variety of artists claim him as their master, from the most plainly conventional of the nineteenth century such as Cabanel or Bouguereau, to the most revolutionary of our century from Matisse to Picasso. A classicist Above all, he was moved by the impulse to penetrate the secret of natural beauty and to reinterpret it through its own means an attitude fundamentally different to that of David ... there results a truly personal and unique art admired as much by the Cubists for its plastic autonomy, as by the Surrealists for its visionary qualities. Ingres is one of the most cited artists in the interpictural compositions of the Peruvian painter Herman BraunVega. The latter dedicated an entire exhibition to him in 2006 on the occasion of the year dedicated to Ingres in France museums.    Violon dIngres  Ingress wellknown passion for playing the violin gave rise to a common expression in the French language, violon dIngres, meaning a second skill beyond the one by which a person is mainly known. Ingres was an amateur violin player from his youth, and played for a time as second violinist for the orchestra of Toulouse. When he was Director of the French Academy in Rome, he played frequently with the music students and guest artists. Charles Gounod, who was a student under Ingres at the Academy, merely noted that he was not a professional, even less a virtuoso. Along with the student musicians, he performed Beethoven string quartets with Niccolò Paganini. In an 1839 letter, Franz Liszt described his playing as charming, and planned to play through all the Mozart and Beethoven violin sonatas with Ingres. Liszt also dedicated his transcriptions of the 5th and 6th symphonies of Beethoven to Ingres on their original publication in 1840. The American avantgarde artist Man Ray used this expression as the title of a famous photograph portraying Alice Prin aka Kiki de Montparnasse in the pose of the Valpinçon Bather with two fholes painted on to make her body resemble a violin.

"Anton Raphael Mengs 12 March 1728  29 June 1779 was a German Neoclassical painter.    Early life   Mengs was born on 12 March 1728, at Ústí nad Labem in the Kingdom of Bohemia, the son of Ismael Mengs, a Danishborn painter who eventually established himself at Dresden, where the court of Electorate of Saxony and PolishLithuanian Commonwealth electors and kings was. His older sister, Therese Concordia Maron, was also a painter, as was his younger sister, Julia. His and Thereses births in Bohemia were mere coincidence. Their mother was not their fathers wife Ismael carried on a yearslong affair with the familys housekeeper, Charlotte Bormann. In an effort to conceal the births of two illegitimate children, Ismael took Charlotte, under the pretext of vacations, to the nearest bigger town abroad, Ústí nad Labem 90 km upstream of the Elbe river. At least in Antons case, Ismael Mengs took his baby and Charlotte back to Dresden a few weeks after the birth. There they lived for the next 13 years.  In 1741, Ismael moved his family from Dresden to Rome, where he copied in miniature some works of Raphael for the Elector of Saxony, which were intended for Dresden.    Adulthood  In 1749, Anton Raphael Mengs was appointed the first painter to Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony, but this did not prevent him from continuing to spend much of his time in Rome. There he married Margarita Guazzi, who had sat for him as a model in 1748. In 1749, Mengs accepted a commission from the Duke of Northumberland to make a copy, in oil on canvas, of Raphaels fresco The School of Athens for his London home. Executed in 17525, Mengss painting is fullsized, but he adapted the composition to a rectangular format and added other figures. It is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He converted to Catholicism, and in 1754 he became director of the Vatican painting school. In 1757, Mengs painted a superb fresco on the dome of the church of SantEusebio in Rome. His fresco painting Parnassus at Villa Albani gained him a reputation as a master painter. On two occasions he accepted invitations from Charles III of Spain to go to Madrid, first in 1761. There he produced some of his best work, most notably the ceiling of the banqueting hall of the Royal Palace of Madrid, the subject of which was the Triumph of Trajan and the Temple of Glory. After the completion of this work in 1777, Mengs returned to Rome, where he died two years later, in poor circumstances, leaving twenty children, seven of whom were pensioned by the king of Spain.   Mengs died in Rome in June 1779 and was buried there in the Church of Santi Michele e Magno.    Career   His portraits and selfportraits show an attention to detail and insight often lost in his grander paintings. His closeness to Johann Joachim Winckelmann has enhanced his historical importance. Mengs came to share Winckelmanns enthusiasm for classical antiquity, and worked to establish the dominance of Neoclassical painting over the then popular Rococo style. At the same time, however, the influence of the Roman Baroque remained strong in his work, particularly in his religious paintings. He would have fancied himself the first neoclassicist, while, in fact, he may be the last flicker of Baroque art. Rudolf Wittkower wrote In the last analysis, he is as much an end as a beginning. Goethe regretted that so much learning should have been allied to a total want of initiative and poverty of invention, and embodied with a strained and artificial mannerism.  Mengs had a wellknown rivalry with the contemporary Italian painter Pompeo Batoni. He was also a friend of Giacomo Casanova. Casanova provides accounts of his personality and contemporary reputation through anecdotes in his Histoire de ma vie. Among his pupils in Italy were Anton von Maron Antonio Maron Vienna, 1731 Naples, 1761. His pupils in Spain included Agustín Esteve, Francisco Bayeu and Mariano Salvador Maella. Besides numerous paintings in Madrid, the Ascension and St Joseph at Dresden, Perseus and Andromeda at Saint Petersburg, and the ceiling of the Villa Albani are among his chief works. A Noli me tangere was commissioned as an altarpiece by All Souls College, Oxford, and is now held in the National Gallery, London. Another altarpiece was installed in Magdalen College, Oxford.    Theoretical writings  Mengs wrote about art in Spanish, Italian, and German. His friendship with Winckelmann notwithstanding, Mengs was little influenced by Winckelmanns ideas the basis of his extensive writings on art is to be found in the traditional theories that go back to Bellori. He reveals an eclectic theory of art that sees perfection as attainable through a wellbalanced fusion of diverse excellences Greek design combined with the expression of Raphael, the chiaroscuro of Correggio, and the colour of Titian.

"PierreNarcisse, baron Guérin 13 March 1774  6 July 1833 was a French painter, born in Paris.    Biography    A pupil of JeanBaptiste Regnault, he carried off one of the three grands prix offered in 1796, in consequence of the competition not having taken place since 1793. In 1799, his painting The Return of Marcus Sextus Louvre was exhibited at the Salon and excited wild enthusiasm. Part of this was due to the subject  a victim of Sullas proscription returning to Rome to find his wife dead and his house in mourning  in which an allusion was found to the turmoil of the French Revolution. Guérin on this occasion was publicly crowned by the president of the institute, and went to Rome to study under JosephBenoît Suvée. In 1800, unable to remain in Rome on account of his health, he went to Naples, where he painted The Shepherds in the Tomb of Amyntas . In 1802 Guérin produced Phaedra and Hippolytus Louvre in 1810, after his return to Paris, he again achieved a great success with Andromache and Pyrrhus Louvre and in the same year also exhibited Aurora and Cephalus Pushkin Museum and Bonaparte and the Rebels of Cairo Versailles. These paintings suited the popular taste of the First Empire, being highly melodramatic and pompously dignified. The Restoration brought to Guérin fresh honours he had received from the first consul in 1803 the cross of the Legion of Honour, and in 1815 Louis XVIII named him to the Académie des BeauxArts. His style changed to accord with popular taste. In Aeneas Relating to Dido the Disasters of Troy Louvre, Guérin adopted a more sensuous, picturesque style. Guérin was commissioned to paint for the Madeleine a scene from the history of St Louis, but his health prevented him from accomplishing what he had begun, and in 1822 he accepted the post of director of the French Academy in Rome, which in 1816 he had refused. On returning to Paris in 1828, Guérin, who had previously been made chevalier of the order of St. Michel, was ennobled. He now attempted to complete Pyrrhus and Priam, a work which he had begun at Rome, but in vain his health had finally broken down, and in the hope of improvement he returned to Italy with Horace Vernet. Shortly after his arrival at Rome Baron Guérin died, on 6 July 1833, and was buried in the church of La Trinité de Monti by the side of Claude Lorrain. A heroic portrait by Guerin hangs in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore. An 1821 gift of King Louis XVIII, it depicts the episode of the Descent from the Cross.    Pupils  Many artists studied with Guérin, among them Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, Ary and Hendrik Scheffer.

"TITLE Francisco Goya Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes  Spanish fɾanˈθisko xoˈse ðe ˈɣoʝa i luˈθjentes 30 March 1746  16 April 1828 was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th and 20thcentury painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragon to a middleclass family in 1746. He studied painting from age 14 under José Luzán y Martínez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococostyle tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace. Although Goyas letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and more pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social, and political levels and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became Primer Pintor de Cámara Prime Court Painter, the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his La maja desnuda, a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Velázquez. In 180001, he painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family, also influenced by Velázquez. In 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his Disasters of War series of prints although published 35 years after his death and his 1814 paintings The Second of May 1808 and The Third of May 1808. Other works from his midperiod include the Caprichos and Los Disparates etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his countrys fate and his own mental and physical health. His late period culminates with the Black Paintings of 18191823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo House of the Deaf Man where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his La Tauromaquia series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.    Early years 17461771   Francisco de Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragón, Spain, on 30 March 1746 to José Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador. The family had moved that year from the city of Zaragoza, but there is no record of why likely, José was commissioned to work there. They were lower middleclass. José was the son of a notary and of Basque origin, his ancestors being from Zerain, earning his living as a gilder, specialising in religious and decorative craftwork. He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar Santa Maria del Pilar, the principal cathedral of Zaragoza. Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita b. 1737, brother Tomás b. 1739 who was to follow in his fathers trade and second sister Jacinta b. 1743. There were two younger sons, Mariano b. 1750 and Camilo b. 1753. His mothers family had pretensions of nobility and the house, a modest brick cottage, was owned by her family and, perhaps fancifully, bore their crest. About 1749 José and Gracia bought a home in Zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city. Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas Pías de San Antón, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics. According to Robert Hughes the artist seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting ... were very down to earth Goya was no theoretician. At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Martín Zapater the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapaters death in 1803 give valuable insight into Goyas early years at the court in Madrid.    Visit to Italy  At age 14 Goya studied under the painter José Luzán, where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on paint from my invention. He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.  Rome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht Dürer. He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent. It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a Sacrifice to Vesta and a Sacrifice to Pan, both dated 1771. In 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of Parma. That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the cupolas of the Basilica of the Pillar including Adoration of the Name of God, a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace. He studied with the Aragonese artist Francisco Bayeu y Subías and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous. He befriended Francisco Bayeu and married his sister Josefa he nicknamed her Pepa on 25 July 1773. Their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos, was born on 29 August 1774. Of their seven children only one, a son named Javier, survived into adulthood.    Madrid 17751789   Francisco Bayeu Josefa Bayeus brother, 1765 membership of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and directorship of the tapestry works from 1777 helped Goya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the Royal Tapestry Factory. Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of El Escorial and the Palacio Real del Pardo, the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are mostly popular in a rococo style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention. The cartoons were not his only royal commissions and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as Marcantonio Raimondi and Velázquez. Goya had a complicated relationship with the latter artist while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goyas attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the longdead painters works that had been contained in the royal collection. Nonetheless, etching was a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs. His c. 1779 etching of The Garrotted Man El agarrotado was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later Disasters of War series.  Goya was beset by illness, and his condition was used against him by his rivals, who looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature. Some of the larger cartoons, such as The Wedding, were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal. However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the impasto and glazing techniques he was by then applying to his painted works. The tapestries seem as comments on human types, fashion and fads. Other works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the Church of San Francisco El Grande in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art.    Court painter   In 1783, the Count of Floridablanca, favorite of King Charles III, commissioned Goya to paint his portrait. He became friends with the Kings halfbrother Luis, and spent two summers working on portraits of both the Infante and his family. During the 1780s, his circle of patrons grew to include the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, the King and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted. In 1786, Goya was given a salaried position as a painter to Charles III. Goya was appointed court painter to Charles IV in 1789. The following year he became First Court Painter, with a salary of 50,000 reales and an allowance of 500 ducats for a coach. He painted portraits of the king and the queen, and the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy and many other nobles. These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter his Charles IV of Spain and His Family is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family. Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV.  Under his reign his wife Louisa was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts Lot and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay. Goya earned commissions from the highest ranks of the Spanish nobility, including Pedro TéllezGirón, 9th Duke of Osuna and his wife María Josefa Pimentel, 12th CountessDuchess of Benavente, José Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and his wife María del Pilar de Silva, and María Ana de Pontejos y Sandoval, Marchioness of Pontejos. In 1801 he painted Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief War of the Oranges against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goyas 1801 portrait is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoys fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms. Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned La maja desnuda.    Middle period 17931799   La Maja Desnuda La maja desnuda has been described as the first totally profane lifesize female nude in Western art without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning. The identity of the Majas is uncertain. The most popularly cited models are the Duchess of Alba, with whom Goya was sometimes thought to have had an affair, and Pepita Tudó, mistress of Manuel de Godoy. Neither theory has been verified, and it remains as likely that the paintings represent an idealized composite. The paintings were never publicly exhibited during Goyas lifetime and were owned by Godoy. In 1808 all Godoys property was seized by Ferdinand VII after his fall from power and exile, and in 1813 the Inquisition confiscated both works as obscene, returning them in 1836 to the Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. In 1798 he painted luminous and airy scenes for the pendentives and cupola of the Real Ermita Chapel of San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. His depiction of a miracle of Saint Anthony of Padua is devoid of the customary angels and instead treats the miracle as if it were a theatrical event performed by ordinary people.  At some time between late 1792 and early 1793, an undiagnosed illness left Goya deaf. He became withdrawn and introspective while the direction and tone of his work changed. He began the series of aquatinted etchings, published in 1799 as the Caprichoscompleted in parallel with the more official commissions of portraits and religious paintings. In 1799 Goya published 80 Caprichos prints depicting what he described as the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or selfinterest have made usual. The visions in these prints are partly explained by the caption The sleep of reason produces monsters. Yet these are not solely bleak they demonstrate the artists sharp satirical wit, as in Capricho number 52, What a Tailor Can Do While convalescing between 1793 and 1794, Goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that marked a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art, and drew from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare. Yard with Lunatics is a vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation. The condemnation of brutality towards prisoners whether criminal or insane is a subject that Goya assayed in later works that focused on the degradation of the human figure. It was one of the first of Goyas mid1790s cabinet paintings, in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career. He was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness, and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own selfdoubt, anxiety and fear that he was losing his mind. Goya wrote that the works served to occupy my imagination, tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings. The series, he said, consisted of pictures which normally find no place in commissioned works. Goyas physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the French declaration of war on Spain. A contemporary reported, The noises in his head and deafness arent improving, yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance. These symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral encephalitis, or possibly a series of miniature strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centres of the brain. Symptoms of tinnitus, episodes of imbalance and progressive deafness are typical of Ménières disease. It is possible that Goya had cumulative lead poisoning, as he used massive amounts of lead whitewhich he ground himselfin his paintings, both as a canvas primer and as a primary colour. Other postmortem diagnostic assessments include Susacs syndrome or may point toward paranoid dementia, possibly due to brain trauma, as evidenced by marked changes in his work after his recovery, culminating in the black paintings. Art historians have noted Goyas singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally, and allows his audience to find its own catharsis in the images.    Peninsular War 18081814  The French army invaded Spain in 1808, leading to the Peninsular War of 18081814. The extent of Goyas involvement with the court of the intruder king, Joseph I, the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, is not known he painted works for French patrons and sympathisers, but kept neutral during the fighting. After the restoration of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefas death in 1812, he was painting The Second of May 1808 and The Third of May 1808, and preparing the series of etchings later known as The Disasters of War Los desastres de la guerra. Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial. The artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries, but not for the king himself. Although Goya did not make his intention known when creating The Disasters of War, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. The scenes are singularly disturbing, sometimes macabre in their depiction of battlefield horror, and represent an outraged conscience in the face of death and destruction. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons. The first 47 plates in the series focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series plates 48 to 64 record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 181112, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform. Since their first publication, Goyas scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the prodigious flowering of rage.  His works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits, but also include the altarpiece of Santa Justa and Santa Rufina for the Cathedral of Seville, the print series of La Tauromaquia depicting scenes from bullfighting, and probably the etchings of Los Disparates.    Quinta del Sordo and Black Paintings 18191822   Records of Goyas later life are relatively scant, and ever politically aware, he suppressed a number of his works from this period, working instead in private. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in nearsolitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as La Quinta del Sordo The House of the Deaf Man, after the nearest farmhouse that had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man. Art historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into Medievalism. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812. At the age of 75, alone and in mental and physical despair, he completed the work of his 14 Black Paintings, all of which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house. Goya did not intend for the paintings to be exhibited, did not write of them, and likely never spoke of them. Around 1874, 50 years after his death, they were taken down and transferred to a canvas support by owner Baron Frédéric Émile dErlanger. Many of the works were significantly altered during the restoration, and in the words of Arthur Lubow what remain are at best a crude facsimile of what Goya painted. The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint. Today, they are on permanent display at the Museo del Prado, Madrid.    Bordeaux October 1824  1828   Leocadia Weiss née Zorrilla, 17901856, the artists maid, younger by 35 years, and a distant relative, lived with and cared for Goya after Bayeus death. She stayed with him in his Quinta del Sordo villa until 1824 with her daughter Rosario. Leocadia was probably similar in features to Goyas first wife Josefa Bayeu, to the point that one of his wellknown portraits bears the cautious title of Josefa Bayeu or Leocadia Weiss. Not much is known about her beyond her fiery temperament. She was likely related to the Goicoechea family, a wealthy dynasty into which the artists son, Javier, had married. It is known that Leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler, Isidore Weiss, but was separated from him since 1811, after he had accused her of illicit conduct. She had two children before that time, and bore a third, Rosario, in 1814 when she was 26. Isidore was not the father, and it has often been speculatedalthough with little firm evidencethat the child belonged to Goya. There has been much speculation that Goya and Weiss were romantically linked however, it is more likely the affection between them was sentimental. Goya died on 16 April 1828. Leocadia was left nothing in Goyas will mistresses were often omitted in such circumstances, but it is also likely that he did not want to dwell on his mortality by thinking about or revising his will. She wrote to a number of Goyas friends to complain of her exclusion but many of her friends were Goyas also and by then were old men or had died, and did not reply. Largely destitute, she moved into rented accommodation, later passing on her copy of the Caprichos for free. Goyas body was later reinterred in the Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. Goyas skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, Send Goya, with or without head.    Goyas influence on modern and contemporary artists and writers  Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Among the 20thcentury painters influenced by Goya are the Spanish masters Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí who drew influence from Los caprichos and the Black Paintings of Goya. In the 21st century, American postmodern painters such as Michael Zansky and Bradley Rubenstein draw inspiration from The Dream of Reason Produces Monsters 179698 and Goyas Black Paintings. Zanksys Giants and Dwarf Series 19902002 of largescale paintings and wood carvings use imagery from Goya. Goyas influence has extended beyond the visual arts  The Spanish composer Enrique Granados wrote a suite for solo piano in 1911 based on Goyas paintings called Goyescas, and later wrote an opera of the same name based on the suite. Spanish author Fernando Arrabals novel The Burial of the Sardine was inspired by Goyas painting. Russian poet Andrei Voznesenskys I Am Goya was inspired by Goyas antiwar paintings. The video game Impasto was based on the works of Goya. In 2024, an extensive exhibition of Goyas etchings was held at the Norton Simon Museum in Southern California.

"Eugène Delacroix Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix  DELəkrwah, ⁠KRWAH French øʒɛn dəlakʁwa 26 April 1798  13 August 1863 was a French Romantic artist who was regarded as the leader of the French Romantic school. In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the forces of the sublime, of nature in often violent action. However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible. Together with Ingres, Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting and is one of the few who was ever photographed. As a painter and muralist, Delacroixs use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott, and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.    Early life   Eugène Delacroix was born on 26 April 1798 at CharentonSaintMaurice in Seine, near Paris. His mother was Victoire Oeben, the daughter of the cabinetmaker JeanFrançois Oeben. He had three much older siblings. CharlesHenri Delacroix 17791845 rose to the rank of General in Napoleons army. Henriette 17801827 married the diplomat Raymond de Verninac SaintMaur 17621822. Henri was born six years later. He was killed at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807. There are medical reasons to believe that Eugènes legal father, CharlesFrançois Delacroix, was not able to procreate at the time of Eugènes conception. Talleyrand, who was a friend of the family and successor of Charles Delacroix as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and whom the adult Eugène resembled in appearance and character, considered himself as his real father. After assuming his office as foreign minister, Talleyrand dispatched Charles Delacroix to The Hague in the capacity of French ambassador to the then Batavian Republic. Delacroix, who at the time suffered from erectile dysfunction, returned to Paris in early September 1797, only to find his wife pregnant. Talleyrand went on to assist Eugène in the form of numerous anonymous commissions. Throughout his career as a painter, he was protected by Talleyrand, who served successively the Restoration and king LouisPhilippe, and ultimately as ambassador of France in Great Britain, and later by Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny, halfbrother of Napoleon III, Grandson of Talleyrand, and speaker of the French House of Commons. His legitimate father, Charles Delacroix, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving 16yearold Eugène an orphan.  His early education was at the Lycée LouisleGrand, and at the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen where he steeped himself in the classics and won awards for drawing. In 1815 he began his training with PierreNarcisse Guérin in the neoclassical style of JacquesLouis David. An early church commission, The Virgin of the Harvest 1819, displays a Raphaelesque influence, but another such commission, The Virgin of the Sacred Heart 1821, evidences a freer interpretation. It precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, and fellow French artist Théodore Géricault, whose works marked an introduction to Romanticism in art. The impact of Géricaults The Raft of the Medusa was profound, and stimulated Delacroix to produce his first major painting, The Barque of Dante, which was accepted by the Paris Salon of 1822. The work caused a sensation, and was largely derided by the public and officialdom, yet was purchased by the State for the Luxembourg Galleries the pattern of widespread opposition to his work, countered by a vigorous, enlightened support, would continue throughout his life. Two years later he again achieved popular success for his The Massacre at Chios.    Career     Chios and Missolonghi   Delacroixs painting of Chios Massacre during the Greek civil wars of 18231825 shows dying Greek civilians rounded up for enslavement by the Ottoman Empire. This is one of several paintings he made of contemporary events, expressing the official policy for the Greek cause in Greek War of Independence against the Turks, the English, the Russians, and the French governments. Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style, and the picture was bought by the state. His depiction of suffering was controversial, however, as there was no glorious event taking place, no patriots raising their swords in valour as in Davids Oath of the Horatii, only a disaster. Many critics deplored the paintings despairing tone the artist AntoineJean Gros called it a massacre of art. The pathos in the depiction of an infant clutching its dead mother had an especially powerful effect, although this detail was condemned as unfit for art by Delacroixs critics. A viewing of the paintings of John Constable and the watercolour sketches and art of Richard Parkes Bonnington prompted Delacroix to make extensive, freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape.  Delacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of Missolonghi by Turkish forces in 1825. With a restrained palette appropriate to the allegory, Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi depicts a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms halfraised in an imploring gesture before the horrific scene the suicide of the Greeks, who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is visible at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet Byron, whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there.    Romanticism   A trip to England in 1825 included visits to Thomas Lawrence and Richard Parkes Bonington, and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only fulllength portrait, the elegant Portrait of LouisAuguste Schwiter 182630. At roughly the same time, Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes, many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years. By 1825, he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare, and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from Goethes Faust. Paintings such as The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan 1826, and Woman with Parrot 1827, introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent. These various romantic strands came together in The Death of Sardanapalus 182728. Delacroixs painting of the death of the Assyrian king Sardanapalus shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with colours, exotic costumes and tragic events. The Death of Sardanapalus depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is a play by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines. Sardanapalus attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in Romantic imagery in this period in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat is about to be cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time. A variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in The Murder of the Bishop of Liège 1829. It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts a scene from the Middle Ages, that of the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, William de la Marck. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in Rouen and Westminster Hall, the drama plays out in chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the paintings vibrant handling as Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, The Murder of the Bishop of Liège was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything.    Liberty Leading the People   Delacroixs most influential work came in 1830 with the painting Liberty Leading the People, which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style. Less obviously, it also differs from the Romanticism of Géricault, as exemplified by The Raft of the Medusa.  Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions... Probably Delacroixs bestknown painting, Liberty Leading the People is an unforgettable image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward under the banner of the tricolour representing liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis Philippe I, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly against a background of smoke. Although the French government bought the painting, by 1832 officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view. Nonetheless, Delacroix still received many government commissions for murals and ceiling paintings. Following the Revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of King Louis Philippe, Liberty Leading the People was finally put on display by the newly elected president, Louis Napoleon Napoleon III. It is exhibited in the Louvre museum in Paris although from December 2012 until 2014 it was on exhibit at LouvreLens in Lens, PasdeCalais. The boy holding a pistol aloft on the right is sometimes thought to be an inspiration for the Gavroche character in Victor Hugos 1862 novel, Les Misérables.    Religious works   Delacroix painted hundreds of religious works in his lifetime and had a strong interest in Christianity. He had many commissions for religious paintings, including pieces for the SaintsAnges chapel of SaintSulpice in Paris. His religious paintings and style would shift drastically depending on the needs of the commission. Some of his religious works, such as Christ on the Sea of Galilee, had multiple painted versions. Delacroixs Pietà, a painting of the Virgin Mary mourning Christ after his death, was eventually redone by Vincent van Gogh. Delacroix reflected on religion through his paintings, and his religious works often show subtle details to Biblical texts. While considered an unbeliever or agnostic, his journal and paintings reveal an openness and receptiveness to spirituality through his art.    Travel to North Africa   In 1832, Delacroix traveled to Spain and North Africa in company with the diplomat CharlesEdgar de Mornay, as part of a diplomatic mission to Morocco shortly after the French conquered Algeria. He went not primarily to study art, but to escape from the civilization of Paris, in hopes of seeing a more primitive culture. He eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of North Africa, and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in Orientalism. Delacroix was entranced by the people and their clothes, and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings. He believed that the North Africans, in their attire and their attitudes, provided a visual equivalent to the people of Classical Rome and Greece  The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus...  He managed to sketch some women secretly in Algiers, as in the painting Women of Algiers in their Apartment 1834, but generally he encountered difficulty in finding Muslim women to pose for him because of Muslim rules requiring that women be covered. Less problematic was the painting of Jewish women in North Africa, as subjects for the Jewish Wedding in Morocco 1839. While in Tangier, Delacroix made many sketches of the people and the city, subjects to which he would return until the end of his life. Animalsthe embodiment of romantic passionwere incorporated into paintings such as Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable 1860, The Lion Hunt of which there exist many versions, painted between 1856 and 1861, and Arab Saddling his Horse 1855.    Musical inspirations   Delacroix drew inspiration from many sources over his career, such as the literary works of William Shakespeare and Lord Byron, and the artistry of Michelangelo. But, throughout his life, he felt a constant need for music, saying in 1855 that nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling. He also said, while working at SaintSulpice, that music put him in a state of exaltation that inspired his painting. It was often from music, whether the most melancholy renditions of Chopin or the pastoral works of Beethoven, that Delacroix was able to draw the most emotion and inspiration. At one point during his life, Delacroix befriended and made portraits of the composer Chopin in his journal, Delacroix praised him frequently.    Murals and later life  In 1838 Delacroix exhibited Medea about to Kill Her Children, which created a sensation at the Salon. His first largescale treatment of a scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts Medea clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by Jason. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light that penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the Lille Musée des BeauxArts he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined The Barque of Dante and Scenes from the Massacres of Chios. From 1833 on Delacroix received numerous commissions to decorate public buildings in Paris. In that year he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des Députés, Palais Bourbon, which was not completed until 1837, and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist MarieÉlisabeth BlavotBoulanger. For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large Pietà, and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the Galerie dApollon of the Louvre. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the Church of SaintSulpice in Paris. They included Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon, and The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. These commissions offered him the opportunity to compose on a large scale in an architectural setting, much as had those masters he admired, Paolo Veronese, Tintoretto, and Rubens. The work was fatiguing, and during these years he suffered from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition to his home in Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in Champrosay, where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, JeanneMarie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years. In 1862 Delacroix participated in the creation of the Société Nationale des BeauxArts. His friend, the writer Théophile Gautier, became chairman, with the painter Aimé Millet acting as deputy chairman. In addition to Delacroix, the committee was composed of the painters CarrierBelleuse and Puvis de Chavannes. Among the exhibitors were Léon Bonnat, JeanBaptiste Carpeaux, CharlesFrançois Daubigny, Gustave Doré, and Édouard Manet. Just after his death in 1863, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs by Delacroixand ceased to mount any further exhibitions. The winter of 186263 was extremely rough for Delacroix he was suffering from a severe throat infection that worsened over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after their conversation. On 1 June, he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was feeling better and returned to his country house. However, by 15 July, he was ill enough to see his doctor again, who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could consume was fruit. Delacroix recognized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while instructing everything in his studio to be sold. He also included a clause forbidding any representation of his features, whether by a deathmask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly. On 13 August, Delacroix died, with Jenny by his side. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His country house survives at 11, rue Alphonse Daudet, Draveil.    Legacy   At the sale of his work in 1864, 9140 works were attributed to Delacroix, including 853 paintings, 1525 pastels and water colours, 6629 drawings, 109 lithographs, and over 60 sketch books. The number and quality of the drawings, whether done for constructive purposes or to capture a spontaneous movement, underscored his explanation, Colour always occupies me, but drawing preoccupies me. Delacroix produced several fine selfportraits, and a number of memorable portraits which seem to have been done purely for pleasure, among which were the portrait of fellow artist Baron Schwiter, an inspired small oil of the violinist Niccolò Paganini, and Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand, a double portrait of his friends, the composer Frédéric Chopin and writer George Sand the painting was cut after his death, but the individual portraits survive. On occasion Delacroix painted pure landscapes The Sea at Dieppe, 1852 and still lifes Still Life with Lobsters, 182627, both of which feature the virtuoso execution of his figurebased works. He is also well known for his Journal, in which he gave eloquent expression to his thoughts on art and contemporary life. A generation of impressionists was inspired by Delacroixs work. Renoir and Manet made copies of his paintings, and Degas purchased the portrait of Baron Schwiter for his private collection. His painting at the church of SaintSulpice has been called the finest mural painting of his time. Contemporary Chinese artist Yue Minjun has created his own interpretation of Delacroixs painting Massacre of Chios, which retains the same name. Yue Minjuns painting was itself sold at Sothebys for nearly $4.1 million in 2007. His pencil drawing Moorish Conversation on a Terrace was discovered as part of the Munich Art Hoard.

" ""Caspar David Friedrich Caspar David Friedrich German ˌkaspaʁ ˌdaːvɪt ˈfʁiːdʁɪç  5 September 1774  7 May 1840 was a German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation, whose often symbolic, and anticlassical work, conveys a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrichs paintings often set contemplative human figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. Art historian Christopher John Murray described their presence, in diminished perspective, amid expansive landscapes, as reducing the figures to a scale that directs the viewers gaze towards their metaphysical dimension. Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen 17941798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization. Friedrichs work brought him renown early in his career. Contemporaries such as the French sculptor David dAngers spoke of him as having discovered the tragedy of landscape. His work nevertheless fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrichs contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his art, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirtytwo of his paintings in Berlin. His work influenced Expressionist artists and later Surrealists and Existentialists. The rise of Nazism in the early 1930s saw a resurgence in Friedrichs popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, seen as promoting German nationalism.    Life     Early years and family   Caspar David Friedrich was born on 5 September 1774, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania, on the Baltic coast of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he was raised in the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a candlemaker and soap boiler. Records of the familys financial circumstances are contradictory while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty. He became familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie, died in 1781 when he was seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, and a second sister, Maria, succumbed to typhus in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.  Friedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art department is now named CasparDavidFriedrichInstitut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich to the work of the German 17thcentury artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen four years later, where he began by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life.  Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallerys collection of 17thcentury Dutch landscape painting. At the academy, he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neoclassical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.    Move to Dresden  Friedrich settled permanently in Dresden in 1798. During this early period, he experimented in printmaking with etchings and designs for woodcuts which his furnituremaker brother cut. By 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends. Despite these forays into other media, he gravitated toward working primarily with ink, watercolour and sepias. With the exception of a few early pieces, such as Landscape with Temple in Ruins 1797, he did not work extensively with oils until his reputation was more established. Landscapes were his preferred subject, inspired by frequent trips, beginning in 1801, to the Baltic coast, Bohemia, the Krkonoše and the Harz Mountains. Mostly based on the landscapes of northern Germany, his paintings depict woods, hills, harbours, morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature. These works were modelled on sketches and studies of scenic spots, such as the cliffs on Rügen, the surroundings of Dresden and the river Elbe. He executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil, even providing topographical information, yet the subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of Friedrichs midperiod paintings were rendered from memory. These effects took their strength from the depiction of light, and of the illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water optical phenomena peculiar to the Baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis.  His reputation as an artist was established when he won a prize in 1805 at the Weimar competition organised by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At the time, the Weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and nowforgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neoclassical and pseudoGreek styles. The poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to Goethes reputation, so when Friedrich entered two sepia drawingsProcession at Dawn and FisherFolk by the Seathe poet responded enthusiastically and wrote, We must praise the artists resourcefulness in this picture fairly. The drawing is well done, the procession is ingenious and appropriate ... his treatment combines a great deal of firmness, diligence and neatness ... the ingenious watercolour ... is also worthy of praise. Friedrich completed the first of his major paintings in 1808, at the age of 34. Cross in the Mountains, today known as the Tetschen Altar, is an altarpiece panel said to have been commissioned for a family chapel in Tetschen, Bohemia. The panel depicts a cross in profile at the top of a mountain, alone, and surrounded by pine trees. Although the altarpiece was generally coldly received, it was Friedrichs first painting to receive wide publicity. The artists friends publicly defended the work, while art critic Basilius von Ramdohr published a long article challenging Friedrichs use of landscape in a religious context. He rejected the idea that landscape painting could convey explicit meaning, writing that it would be a veritable presumption, if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar. Friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions in 1809, comparing the rays of the evening sun to the light of the Holy Father. This statement marked the only time Friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work, and the painting was among the few commissions the artist ever received.  Following the purchase of two of his paintings by the Prussian Crown Prince, Friedrich was elected a member of the Berlin Academy in 1810. Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority and applied that June for Saxon citizenship. The move was not expected the Saxon government was proFrench, while Friedrichs paintings were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly antiFrench. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresdenbased friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckstädt, Friedrich attained citizenship, and in 1818, membership in the Saxon Academy with a yearly dividend of 150 thalers. Although he had hoped to receive a full professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German Library of Information, it was felt that his painting was too personal, his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students. Politics may have played a role in stalling his career Friedrichs decidedly Germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the eras prevailing proFrench attitudes.    Marriage   On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twentyfiveyearold daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Gustav Adolf, their third child, was named after Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus, and became a notable painter in his own right. The physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrichs life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügenpainted after his honeymoondisplay a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art. Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrichs studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to the Grand Dukes son later Tsar Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. Zhukovsky helped Friedrich for decades, both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family his assistance toward the end of Friedrichs career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friends paintings please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind. Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl 17881857. Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artists final years and he expressed dismay that to the artbuying public, Friedrichs pictures were only curiosities. While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrichs psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrichs landscapes, commenting that artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrichs art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic ... They did not see Friedrichs faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented.    Later life   Friedrichs reputation steadily declined over the final fifteen years of his life. As the ideals of early Romanticism passed from fashion, he came to be viewed as an eccentric and melancholy character, out of touch with the times. Gradually his patrons fell away. By 1820, he was living as a recluse and was described by friends as the most solitary of the solitary. Towards the end of his life he lived in relative poverty. He became isolated and spent long periods of the day and night walking alone through woods and fields, often beginning his strolls before sunrise. He suffered his first stroke in June 1835, which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint. As a result, he was unable to work in oil and limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions. Although his vision remained strong, he had lost the full strength of his hand. Yet he was able to produce a final black painting, Seashore by Moonlight 18351836, described by Vaughan as the darkest of all his shorelines, in which richness of tonality compensates for the lack of his former finesse. Symbols of death appeared in his work from this period. Soon after his stroke, the Russian royal family purchased a number of his earlier works, and the proceeds allowed him to travel to Teplitzin todays Czech Republicto recover. During the mid1830s, Friedrich began a series of portraits and returned to observing himself in nature. As the art historian William Vaughan observed, however, He can see himself as a man greatly changed. He is no longer the upright, supportive figure that appeared in Two Men Contemplating the Moon in 1819. He is old and stiff ... he moves with a stoop. By 1838, he was capable of working in a small format only. He and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends.    Death   Friedrich died in Dresden on 7 May 1840 and was buried in Dresdens TrinitatisFriedhof Trinity Cemetery east of the city centre the entrance to which he had painted with his Cemetery Entrance in 1825. His wife Caroline died in poverty in 1847. By this time his reputation and fame had waned, and his death was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his interpretations were highly original and personal. Carl Gustav Carus later wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to Friedrichs transformation of the conventions of landscape painting.  However, Carus articles placed Friedrich firmly in his time and did not place the artist within a continuing tradition. Only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print, and that was produced in very few copies.    Themes     Landscape and the sublime   The visualisation and portrayal of landscape in an entirely new manner was Friedrichs key innovation. He sought not just to explore the enjoyment of a beautiful view as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a selfcontained emotive subject. His paintings often employed the Rückenfigura person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The vantage point encourages the viewer to identify with the Rückenfigur, and share with the artist the sublime appreciation of nature.  Friedrich created the idea of a landscape full of romantic feelingdie romantische Stimmungslandschaft. His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests and mountain scenes, and often used landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the bestknown paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism. He wrote The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from painting that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead. Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness to the presence of God are frequent elements in Friedrichs landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats moving away from a shore, it is referenced more directly in paintings like The Abbey in the Oakwood 18081810, in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins. He was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is rendered as stark and dead. Friedrichs winter scenes are solemn and stillaccording to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which no man has yet set his foot. The theme of nearly all the older winter pictures had been less winter itself than life in winter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters, the wanderer ... It was Friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life. Instead of many tones, he sought the one and so, in his landscape, he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note.  Bare oak trees and tree stumps, such as those in Raven Tree c. 1822, Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon c. 1824, and Willow Bush under a Setting Sun c. 1835, are recurring elements of his paintings, and usually symbolise death. Countering the sense of despair are Friedrichs symbols for redemption the cross and the clearing sky promise eternal life, and the slender moon suggests hope and the growing closeness of Christ. In his paintings of the sea, anchors often appear on the shore, also indicating a spiritual hope. In The Abbey in the Oakwood, the movement of the monks away from the open grave and toward the cross and the horizon imparts Friedrichs message that the final destination of mans life lies beyond the grave.  With dawn and dusk constituting prominent themes of his landscapes, Friedrichs own later years were characterised by a growing pessimism. His work becomes darker, revealing a fearsome monumentality. The Wreck of the Hopealso known as The Polar Sea or The Sea of Ice 18231824perhaps best summarises Friedrichs ideas and aims at this point, though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received. Completed in 1824, it depicted a grim subject, a shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean the image he produced, with its grinding slabs of travertinecolored floe ice chewing up a wooden ship, goes beyond documentary into allegory the frail bark of human aspiration crushed by the worlds immense and glacial indifference. Friedrichs written commentary on aesthetics was limited to a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained the need for the artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His bestknown remark advises the artist to close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards.    Loneliness and death   Both Friedrichs life and art have at times been perceived as marked by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Art historians and some of his contemporaries attribute such interpretations to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood, while Friedrichs pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the taciturn man from the North. Friedrich suffered depressive episodes in 1799, 18031805, c. 1813, in 1816 and between 1824 and 1826. There are noticeable thematic shifts in the works he produced during these episodes, which see the emergence of such motifs and symbols as vultures, owls, graveyards and ruins. From 1826, these motifs became a permanent feature of his output, while his use of colour became darker and muted. Carus wrote in 1829 that Friedrich is surrounded by a thick, gloomy cloud of spiritual uncertainty, though the noted art historian and curator Hubertus Gassner disagrees with such notions, seeing in Friedrichs work a positive and lifeaffirming subtext inspired by Freemasonry and religion.    Germanic folklore  Reflecting Friedrichs patriotism and resentment of the 1813 French occupation of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An antiFrench German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He was impressed by the antiNapoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleists 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscapea first in the history of art. In Old Heroes Graves 1812, a dilapidated monument inscribed Arminius invokes the Germanic chieftain, a symbol of nationalism, while the four tombs of fallen heroes are slightly ajar, freeing their spirits for eternity. Two French soldiers appear as small figures before a cave, lower and deep in a grotto surrounded by rock, as if farther from heaven. A second political painting, Fir Forest with the French Dragoon and the Raven c. 1813, depicts a lost French soldier dwarfed by a dense forest, while on a tree stump a raven is percheda prophet of doom, symbolizing the anticipated defeat of France.    Legacy     Influence  Alongside other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position landscape painting as a major genre within Western art. Of his contemporaries, Friedrichs style most influenced the painting of Johan Christian Dahl 17881857. Among later generations, Arnold Böcklin 18271901 was strongly influenced by his work, and the substantial presence of Friedrichs works in Russian collections influenced many Russian painters, in particular Arkhip Kuindzhi c. 18421910 and Ivan Shishkin 18321898.  Friedrichs spirituality anticipated American painters such as Albert Pinkham Ryder 18471917, Ralph Blakelock 18471919, the painters of the Hudson River School and the New England Luminists.  At the turn of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art historian Andreas Aubert 18511913, whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch 18631944 would have seen Friedrichs work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munchs 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrichs Rückenfigur back figure, although in Munchs work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground. Friedrichs modern revival gained momentum in 1906, when thirtytwo of his works were featured in an exhibition in Berlin of Romanticera art. His landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of German artist Max Ernst 18911976, and as a result other Surrealists came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement. In 1934, the Belgian painter René Magritte 18981967 paid tribute in his work The Human Condition, which directly echoes motifs from Friedrichs art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer. A few years later, the Surrealist journal Minotaure included Friedrich in a 1939 article by the critic Marie Landsberger, thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists. The influence of The Wreck of Hope or The Sea of Ice is evident in the 194041 painting Totes Meer by Paul Nash 18891946, a fervent admirer of Ernst. Friedrichs work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20thcentury artists, including Mark Rothko 19031970, Gerhard Richter b. 1932, Gotthard Graubner and Anselm Kiefer b. 1945. Friedrichs Romantic paintings have also been singled out by writer Samuel Beckett 190689, who, standing before Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon, said This was the source of Waiting for Godot, you know.  In his 1961 article The Abstract Sublime, originally published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrichs 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turners The Evening Star and Rothkos 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detaila bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscapeis no longer necessary we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night.    Critical appraisal  Until 1890, and especially after his friends had died, Friedrichs work lay in nearoblivion for decades. Yet, by 1890, the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for painterly effect and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time. Friedrichs work was used to promote the Nazi ideology in the 1930s, when attempts were made to align Romantic artist and musicians within the nationalistic Blut und Boden ethos. It took decades for Friedrichs reputation to recover from this association with Nazism. His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of modernism contributed to his fall from favour. In 1949, art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Friedrich worked in the frigid technique of his time, which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting, and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry. Clarks dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artists reputation sustained during the late 1930s. Friedrichs reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors, including Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut BörschSupan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, developed a catalogue raisonné, and placed Friedrich within a purely arthistorical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major international galleries and found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians. Today, his international reputation is well established. He is a national icon in his native Germany, and highly regarded by art historians and connoisseurs across the Western World. He is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity, and according to Vaughan, a believer who struggled with doubt, a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness. In the end, he transcends interpretation, reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery. He has truly emerged as a butterflyhopefully one that will never again disappear from our sight.    Work   Friedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of todays more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted during one of the revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrichs work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.

"J. M. W. Turner Joseph Mallord William Turner  23 April 1775  19 December 1851, known in his time as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colouring, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. His artistic style developed over his lifetime, moving away from Romanticismbypassing the following rising style of Realismand, instead, with his later works being a significant precursor of and presaging the later Impressionist and Abstract Art movements that arose in the decades after his death. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. In 1969 art historian Kenneth Clark wrote of Turner He was a genius of the first orderfar the greatest painter that England has ever produced... Turner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lowermiddleclass family and retained his lowerclass accent, while assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which he often only begrudgingly accepted owing to his troubled and contrary nature. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828. He travelled around Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks. Intensely private, eccentric, and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Evelina 18011874 and Georgiana 18111843, by the widow Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father in 1829 when his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841, Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property in that years census. He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76. Turner is buried in St Pauls Cathedral, London.    Biography     Childhood   Turners father William Turner 17451829 moved to London around 1770 from South Molton, Devon. Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 and baptised on 14 May. He was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, in London. His father  was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, came from a family of butchers. A younger sister, Mary Ann, was born in September 1778 but died in August 1783. There are reasons to question the accepted location and birth date for Turner He sometimes talked of being born in the same year as Napolean and the Duke of Wellington This would put Turners birth date as 1769.  His age at death in the General Register Office death index is 81 which may support his being born in 1769.  However, in the first codicil to his will dated 20 August 1832, he states that his birthday was 23 April. As the birth place of Turner has recently appeared to some persons a matter of doubt, I may here observe that he was born at Barnstaple, and neither in Maidenlane nor at South Molton, if his own words go for anything. Cyrus Redding, Frasers Magazine, February 1852. Turners mother showed signs of mental disturbance from 1785 and was admitted to St Lukes Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street in 1799. She was moved in 1800 to Bethlem Hospital, a mental asylum, where she died in 1804. Turner was sent to his maternal uncle, Joseph Mallord William Marshall, a butcher in Brentford, then a small town on the banks of the River Thames west of London, where Turner attended school. The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this perioda series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswells Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales. Around 1786, Turner was sent to Margate on the northeast Kent coast. There, he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work. By this time, Turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings. His father boasted to the artist Thomas Stothard that My son, sir, is going to be a painter. In 1789, Turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to Sunningwell then in Berkshire, now part of Oxfordshire. A whole sketchbook of work from this time survives, as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turners essential working style for his whole career. Many early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects, including Thomas Hardwick, James Wyatt and Joseph Bonomi the Elder. By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman Thomas Malton, who specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton My real master. Topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies.    Career   Turner entered the Royal Academy of Art in 1789, aged 14, and was accepted into the academy a year later by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He showed an early interest in architecture but was advised by Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, A View of the Archbishops Palace, Lambeth, was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1790 when Turner was 15. As an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from naked models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These were particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the oil titled The Rising Squall, Hot Wells lost until 2024, which foreshadowed his later climatical effects. The British writer Peter Cunningham, in his obituary of Turner, wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities ... and evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated.  In 1796, Turner exhibited Fishermen at Sea, a nocturnal moonlit scene of the Needles off the Isle of Wight, an image of boats in peril. Wilton said that the image was a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century and shows strong influence by artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.  Turner travelled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in the Louvre in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from Walter Ramsden Fawkes of Farnley Hall, near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged 22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of Snow Storm Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the Chevin in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall. Turner was a frequent guest of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House in West Sussex, and painted scenes that Egremont funded, taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays 20 paintings, the largest collection of his work outside the Tate.    Later life  As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His fathers death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter, he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, his housekeeper, Sarah Danby. He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters Evelina Dupuis and Georgiana Thompson. Evelina married Joseph Dupuis on 31 October 1817. It was recorded that her mother, Sarah Danby, was a witness along with Charles Thompson.  Turner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth  after her second husband died, and from 1846 he lived with her as Mr Booth or Admiral Booth in her house at 6 Daviss Place now Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, until his death in December 1851. Turner was a habitual user of snuff in 1838, Louis Philippe I, King of the French, presented a gold snuff box to him. Of two other snuffboxes, an agate and silver example bears Turners name, and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper. Turner formed a short but intense friendship with the artist Edward Thomas Daniell. The painter David Roberts wrote of him that, He adored Turner, when I and others doubted, and taught me to see  to distinguish his beauties over that of others ... the old man really had a fond  personal regard for this young clergyman, which I doubt he ever evinced for the other. Daniell may have supplied Turner with the spiritual comfort he needed after the deaths of his father and friends, and to ease the fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age. After Daniells death in Lycia at the age of 38, he told Roberts he would never form such a friendship again.  Before leaving for the Middle East, Daniell commissioned Turners portrait from John Linnell. Turner had previously refused to sit for the artist, and it was difficult to get his agreement to be portrayed. Daniell positioned the two men opposite each other at dinner, so that Linnell could observe his subject carefully and portray his likeness from memory.His death certificate shows that he died of natural decay at the age of 81.  His place of death was recorded as Davis Place, Cremorne Road which was the residence of Sophia Booth, the woman believed to be his common law wife. He is buried in St Pauls Cathedral, where he lies near the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were The Sun or Son is God, though this may be apocryphal. Turners friend, the architect Philip Hardwick, the son of his old tutor, was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, I must inform you, we have lost him. Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur IV benefactor of Westminster  now Chelsea  Westminster  Hospital, Revd. Henry Scott Trimmer, George Jones RA and Charles Turner ARA.    Art     Style  Turners talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Pipers The Illustrated History of Art, his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles. Turner was recognised as an artistic genius the English art critic John Ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature.  Turners imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires including the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed firsthand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches, and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen at the 1840 Royal Academy of Arts exhibition, where The Slave Ship 1840, and Rockets and Blue Lights Close at Hand to Warn Steamboats of Shoal Water 1840 were first shown. A 2003 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute suggested these two paintings were pendants, due in part to their similar content and size. Turners work drew criticism from contemporaries. An anonymous reviewer of the 1840 Royal Academy exhibition, later identified as John Eagles, called the displayed paintings absurd extravagances that disgrace the Exhibition. Sir George Beaumont, a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, described his paintings as blots. Turners major venture into printmaking was the Liber Studiorum Book of Studies, seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The Liber Studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrains Liber Veritatis Book of Truth, where Claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success.  Turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass MontroseGraem to house his collection of Turner prints. His early works, such as Tintern Abbey 1795, stay true to the traditions of English landscape. In Hannibal Crossing the Alps 1812, an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects. In Turners later years, he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in Rain, Steam and Speed  The Great Western Railway, where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turners work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques. He is also generally regarded as a precursor of abstract painting. High levels of volcanic ash in the atmosphere from the eruption of Mount Tambora during 1816, the Year Without a Summer, led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turners work. John Ruskin said that an early patron, Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bedlam, and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turners style  His true master was Dr Monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend Girtin, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to overestimate. Together with some young artists, Turner was able, in Monros London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospheric effects and illusions of John Robert Cozenss watercolours, some of which were present in Monros house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views was an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.    Materials  Turner experimented with a wide variety of pigments. He used formulations like carmine, despite knowing that they were not longlasting, and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments. As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied. By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.    Gallery     Legacy  Turner left a small fortune, which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists. He planned an almshouse at Twickenham in west London with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested, and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including Thomas Price Turner, received part of his fortune. Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen because there was disagreement over the final site. Twentytwo years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, beginning a process of dispersing the pictures that Turner had wished to be kept together. One of the greatest collectors of his work was Henry Vaughan, who, when he died in 1899, owned more than one hundred watercolours and drawings by Turner and as many prints. His collection included examples of almost every type of work on paper the artist produced, from early topographical drawings and atmospheric landscape watercolours, to brilliant colour studies, literary vignette illustrations and spectacular exhibition pieces. It included nearly a hundred proofs of Liber Studiorum and twentythree drawings connected with it. It was an unparalleled collection that comprehensively represented the diversity, imagination and technical inventiveness of Turners work throughout his sixtyyear career. Vaughan bequeathed most of his Turner collection to British and Irish public galleries and museums, stipulating that the collections of Turners watercolours should be exhibited to the public all at one time, free of charge and only in January, demonstrating an awareness of conservation which was unusual at the time. In 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the National Gallery of British Art now Tate Britain. In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened to house the Turner bequest although some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turners condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly, paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turners provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turners Gallery. St. Marys Church, Battersea, added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982. St Pauls Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and the Victoria  Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope Sheffield Museums  Galleries was compared with his death mask National Portrait Gallery, London by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 200910 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The City of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, on 2 June 1999. Selby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallerys Clore Gallery wing on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910, as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual Turner Prize art award in 1984, named in Turners honour, and 20 years later, the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours founded the Winsor  Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, Turners Britain, with material including The Fighting Temeraire on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turners The Fighting Temeraire was voted Britains greatest painting in a public poll organised by the BBC.    Portrayal  Leo McKern played Turner in The Sun Is God, a 1974 Thames Television production directed by Michael Darlow. The programme aired on 17 December 1974, during the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition in London. British filmmaker Mike Leigh wrote and directed Mr. Turner, a biopic of Turners later years, released in 2014. The film stars Timothy Spall as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the Palme dOr at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, with Spall taking the award for Best Actor. The Bank of England announced that a portrait of Turner, with a backdrop of The Fighting Temeraire, would appear on the £20 note beginning in 2020. It is the first £20 British banknote printed on polymer. The Turner £20 note entered circulation on Thursday, 20 February 2020.    See also  List of paintings by J. M. W.
